# Psych 207 Exam Review

## Chapter 1

### Views of Psych

- **Empiricism**: knowledge comes from your own experiences, born a blank slate
- **Nativism**: Biological & genetics, you're hardwired
- **Structuralism**: Elementary building blocks of the human mind, in a lab
- **Introspection**: Describe your own cog experience
- **Functionalism**: Function; how and why, in real life situations
- **Behaviourism**: Idea that how you act is determined by conditioning
- **School of Gestalt Psych**: can not be reduced to elements, it exists as a whole

### Cog Revolution

- **Human factors engineering**: ww2, person-machine system
- **Linguistics**: Chomsky and language development
- **Neuroscience & localization**: found that cells specialize and localization of the brain
- **Computer Metaphor**: Start comparing human mind to computers

### Paradigms of Cog Psych

- **Information Processing Approach**: Pipeline of processing, use general purpose symbol manipulators
- **Connectionism**: Neural network, big weighted graph, no central place that things are stored, weight of connections depends on how strongly they're related, processed in parallel
- **Evolutionary**: Mind changes to respond to evolutionary pressure, must be good at reasoning and decision making for ancestors
- **Ecological**: Cognition is shaped by context and culture

## Chapter 2

### Structure of the Brain

#### Forebrain

- **Thalamus**: relay station for sensory information
- **Hypothalamus**: regulate basic biological functions: hunger/thirst/temp/libido/basic emotions
- **Hippocoampus**: memory and learning
- **Amygdala**: emotion and aggression
- **Corpus Callosum**: fibers between left and right hemispheres

#### Lobes

- **Frontal Lobe**: Motor movement, making decisions, using working memory
- **Parietal Lobe**: Spatial processing, sensory cortex
- **Occipital Lobe**: Visual Processing
- **Temporal Lobe**: Auditory processing, encoding and decoding long term memory

#### Localization

- **Phrenology**: thought strength was related to size of a part of a brain
- **Double Dissociation**: Showing 2 mental processes being independent of each other

#### Brain Imaging Techniques

- **CAT**: x-rays
- **MRI**: magnetic field, better than CAT scans: no radiation, more detailed)
- **fMRI**: measures oxygenation of the blood in the brain
- **ERP**: Event-Related Potentials, electrical activity as a function of a cognitive task

## Chapter 3

#### Perception

- **Template Matching**: Look for exact match
- **Feature Analysis**: Search for objects from components and features
  - **Selfridge Demons**: dumb feature analyzers, scream when they encounter stimulus they're trained to see, louder the more confident it is, decision demon chooses the loudest screamer
- **Prototype Matching**: Best fit model of template matching
- **Top Down**: using context to identify object as opposed to components

#### Agnosia

- **Apperceptive**: Can perceive contours and outlines, can't match to object, failure to perceive
- **Associative**: can match objects and copy drawings but can't name objects, can perceive, failure to associate
- **Prosopagnosia**: can't recognize faces
- **Capgras Syndrome**: imposters, lack of GSR

## Chapter 4

### Attention

- **Filter Theory / Early Selection**: attention very early in the processing pipeline, before the semantics are processed, information not processed past physical characteristics
- **Cocktail Party Effect**: When someone calls your name, you can hear it even though you're not paying attention, means that you're still processing information that you're not actively paying attention to
- **Leaky filter Model / Attenuation Theory**: Information that has special value passes through the leaky filter and gets processed
- **Corteen and Wood**: Canadian city names paired with electric shock to create GSR response. Diatonic hearing test again, with Canadian cities played in the other channel, GSR registered as they were playing. **Items are processed to the level of semantics**
- **Deutsch-Normal Model**: All information processed to a point where we can access its meaning in long term memory. Selective attention directs our awareness to this information

### Automation and Practice

- **Stroop Effect**: automatic processes interfere with our behaviour: colour words in a different colour
- **Controlled Processes**: those we take serially that require attention, limited capacity, if we attempt another, we won't have enough resources
- **Automatic Processses**: without our intention, often not aware that it's happening, can happen in parallel

### Disorders

- **Visual Neglect**: RH parietal lesion neglects the left visual space of attention, when asked to bisect a line, usually bisects much further to the right, ignores the left side. It exists in memory, just unable to attend to visual memory

## Chapter 5

### Memory

- **Modal Memory of Memory**: Sensation -> Imprinted in sensory memory -> rehearsal: long term memory
- **Sensory Memory**: initial brief storage of sensory information: holds 9-12 items
- **Iconic Memory**: visual sensory memory
- **Partial Report Condition**: given 12 letters, give back as many as you can remember, found that could reliably give back 3 or 4 when asked for a row, lost while giving them back.
- **Iconic memory**:(VISUAL SENSORY) only lasts about 1 second

#### Short Term Memory

- **Serial Position Effect**: good at first and last items
- **Recency effect**: good at remembering recent items
- **We can remember 7 +- 2 items bits of information**
- **Forgetting Theory**:
  - **Trace Decay**: fading of the memory trace
  - **Interference**: disruption of the trace by other traces
    - **Proactive Interference**: can't learn new things cause old things
    - **Retroactive Interference**: can't remember old things cause learning new things
- **After 18 seconds, short-term memory is gone: held for 20-30 seconds**

#### Long term Memory

- **Forgetting**: happens rapidly and then tapers off: large portions of spanish helld for 50 years, significant dropoffs in first 2 years and 2 months
- **Retrieval**: easier retrieval when context of encoding is the same as retrieval

#### Working Memory

- **Thought of limited capacity workspace; storage and control processing**
- Consists of 3 parts:
  - **Central Executive**: attention system
  - **Phonological Loop**: sub-vocal rehearsal and verbal information
  - **Visual-Spatial sketchpad**: retains visual information

#### Semantic + Episodic

- Semantic is facts
- Episodic is memories

#### Amnesia

- Anterograde: can't form new memories, most with antero have retro as well RIP
- Retrograde: loss of memories previous

## Chapter 6

#### Processing and Encoding

- Maintenance rehearsal: memorizing something
- Elaborateive rehearsal: elaborate on the meaning of a concept

#### Memories

- Change, malleable
- **Flashbulb memories**: memories that are crystal clear

#### Semantic Memory

- **Cognitive Economy**: store under similar characteristics, meaning when activated, activation spreads through links to related concepts: **spreading activation**

#### Implicit + Explicit Memory

- Explicit: know you're being tested
- Implicit: Learning that may not be able to tie to an event but if tested would be evident // TODO ?

//TODO what is the primacy effect: first thing that comes to mind?

## Chapter 7

#### Categorization

- **Classical View**: determined by defining properties that are necessary and sufficient (Each member has it and the set is sufficient if it forms an instance)
- **Prototype View**: Idealized representation, typicality a function of the resemblance an instance has with the other members of the group. **Family resemblance** is a measure of its typicality.
- **Exemplar View**: actual representations that we've experienced, compare to previously seen objects
- **Schemata View**: Formed of schema, ex: car accidents have broken glass and police
- **Knowledge-based View**: Use knowledge of a concept and meanings to justify classification -> addresses problems of Prototype and exemplar view. Ex: A collection of things to save.

#### Classification Strategies

- **Simultaneous scanning**: test multiple hypotheses at the same time, heavy load on working memory: not good
- **Successive scanning**: test one after another, time consuming and inefficient
- **Conservative focusing**: chooses cards that are one different from the model: low on working memory but doesn't guarentee a solution
- Effective strategies typically use more working memory

## Chapter 8

#### Visual imagery

- **Method of Loci**: walk yourself through somewhere familiar: need to already know a location
- **Pegword Method**: rhyming pairs, one-bun, two-shoe: need to already have a list
- **Dual Code**: able to remember better because coding happens in a visual level as well as the meaning

#### Visual shape manipulation

- Response time was a function of the degrees of rotation: acted as if they were real objects
- We store both abstract linguistic codes and visual descriptors

## Chapter 9

#### Language

- **Structure of Language**:
  - phonemes = smallest unit of sound
  - morphemes are smallest unit of meaning
- **Comprehension and Production**:
  - **Thoery 1**: perceive sounds in categories that fit the sound of our language
- **Aphasias**: Broca: speech production, Wernicks: unable to process language


//TODO look at chapter 9 quiz?

## Chapter 10

#### Problem Solving Techniques

- **Generate and Test**: try and fail approach
- **Means-Ends Analysis**: Start from beginning, develop sub-goals until you get to the goal
- **Working backwards**: thinking in sub-goals from the end to the beginning
- **Reasoning by analogy**: map to another problem to solve it

#### Blocks in Problem Solving

- **Mental Set**: seeing things a certain way
- **Functional Fixedness**: cognitive bias that stops you from using an object in another way
- **lack of knowledge**: experts think differently

#### Reasoning

- **Deductive Reasoning**: Generic to specific
- **Inductive Reasoning**: reasoning about conclusions that are likely but not guaranteed to be true
- **Content Effect**: context of the problem can facilitate the logical reasoning
- **Believability Effect**: more likely to accept a condition if it's believable

**Two approaches to the study of reasoning**:

- Rule-based: people rely on mental rules but can't consciously think about them to draw conclusions
- Mental models: does not consist of special rules, consists of creating mental models ex: pictures for infomration processing

## Chapter 11

#### Decision Making

- **Availability**: thoughts that are easier to access
- **Representativeness**: How information is presented to us
- **Anchoring**: the first part of the problem dictates the rest of the problem
- **Illusory Correlation**: people expect to see a relationship even though there is none
- **Confirmation Bias**: trying to look for information that confirms your suspicions
- **Overconfidence**: impressions of their own accuracy are inflated
- Experts rely on intuition and making mental models
- Emotions play a huge role in decision making

#### Utility Models

- Expected Value Theory (statistics expected value)
- **Image Theory**: people whittle down their choices before doing any real consideration
- Goals must be compatible with three images:
  - **Value image**: match your values and principles
  - **Trajectory image**: goals for the future
  - **Strategic Image**: the user's plan to attain their goals

## Chapter 12

#### Individual differences in cognition

- Higher ability children and adults able to acquire and store more information than their peers
- **Bell, Hernstein and Murray**: argues that there is a general cognitive ability that remains constant over the lifetime of a person
- **Gardner**: there are several "intelligences"

#### Experts: Chess players

- experts use memory in a very different way
- Able to perform much better in their domain of expertise

#### Bilingualism

- Large exercise in attention, need to know which language to respond with
- Earlier development of selective attention
- more successful at seeing more possibilities
- Do not do as well at retrieving individual words from memory

#### Aging

- semantic mem increases as we gain more experiences
- decline in episodic memory caused by decline in frontal lobes
- **Why we get slower Theory 1**: we get slower in terms of our mind, may decay while we have longer processing times, decline in attention, decline in resources
- **HAROLD**: changes with aging associated with changes in the frontal lobe, processes get worse because they're housed in the frontal lobes

#### Gender

- Men better at spatial, females better at telling when the location of the object has changed
- Female better linguistics, less lateralized = better recovery
