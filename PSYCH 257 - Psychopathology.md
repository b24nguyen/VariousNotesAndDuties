# Psych 207 - Psychopathology

## Lecture 1: Jan 04

**Psychopathology:** Study of mental disorders

**Definitions**

- Psychological abnormality: A breakdown in cognitive, emotional, or behavioral function
- Mental illness ~= Psychological abnormality
- Psychopathology has 2 meanings
    - the study of psychological and behavioral dysfunction
    - specific problems faced by people with abnormality
- Psychological disorder: the manifestation of a psych abnormality that meets specific criteria set by experts. Syndrome is a group of symptoms that consistently occur together or a condition characterized by a set of symptoms

**Abnormality**

- not clearly defined: no boundaries between normal and abnormality
- many are defined culturally (Homosexuality)
- Criteria proposed:
    - **Statistical criteria** ("unusual" criteria does not always work), highly talented individuals that are abnormal do not have a mental disorder
    - **Personal distress**: some mental disorders don't provide mental distress
    - **Dysfunction** (evolutionary or adaptive perspective)
- Examples:
    - **Pedophilia**: does not meet any of the criteria and acceptable in some cultures. Based on the need to protect those who are at risk for abuse / can't defend themselves
    - **Homosexuality**: removed from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders in 1973
    - **Intellectual Disability**:

## Lecture 2: Jan 06

**Mind, Body and Soul**

- Are they different, are they the same? do they exist and are they mutually exclusive or intertwined

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Greek Tradition)**

- Socrates and Plato:
    - Rationalism
    - Inner voice
- Hippocrates
    - 4 humours related to 4 body fluids (yellow & black bile, blood phlegm)
    - sanguine (optimistic and social)
    - choleric (short-tempered or irritable)
    - melancholic (analytical and quiet)
    - phlegmatic (relaxed and peaceful)
    - Thought mental illness is an imbalance in the body
    - Concepts of melancholia and manic-depression

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Arab Tradition)**

- Avicenna
    - Traveled and created a large textbook called: The Canon of Medicine
    - Attempted to connect mental illness to the body
    - Created asylums that could take care of the mentally ill

**Dark Ages of the Middle Ages**

- Christianity: mental illness was a moral issue, religious and political tool
- Madness was a consequence of sinning
- Seen as demonic influence and possession
- Witch hunts during European wars and in the New World (Salem, MA)

**Renee Descartes**

- One of the most influential thinkers
- **Cogito ergo sum**: I think, therefore I am
- **Cartesian Dualism**:
    - universe is both mind and matter
    - The dualism still debated

**From Ancient thought to Psychiatry**

- Ideas of the body-mind connection
- Asylums to hide people away

**Enlightenment (18th Century)**

- Phillipe Pinel (France)
    - Started to care for the mentally ill, introduced moral therapy and compassion
    - Chief physician
    - Proposed individualized treatment and humane approach to mentally ill
    - Didn't last long, went back to locking up the mentally ill
- Benjamin Rush
    - Founder of American Psychiatry
    - Advocated of good treatment (clean environment w personal hygiene)
    - Rotational Therapy - imbalance in the brain so just spin them so it balances out

**Biological Tradition**

- Emil Kraepelin
    - Thought if you classified symptoms well enough then you could treat them properly
    - Symptoms that occur together often can be called a disease
    - Created basis of classification systems

- Egas Moniz
    - Nobel prize for discovery of lobotomy as a treatment for psychosis
    - One of the only available treatments until 1950s, despite severe side effect
    - Separated prefrontal cortex from other parts of the brain even though they became brain dead/ numb

**Medical Biological Model (modern)**

- International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11):
    - Focused on prevention and reduction of burden
    - Not only mental disorders, all kinds of diseases and disorders
    - Very cheap, across the world
- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
    - Used in NA
    - Originated in USA
    - Specific to psychopathology
    - Defines symptoms and treatment

## Chapter 1 : Summary

- Statistical (frequency), Personal Distress, Personal Dysfunction (interferes with functioning), Violation of Social Norms, Experts all attempt to classify abnormal behaviour
- Prehistoric times: thought it was supernatural
- Greeks and Romans thought they were biological causes
- Arabs treated it humanely with environmental and psychological factors emphasized
- Middle Ages, thought it was demons
- Lobotomies to treat mental disorders
- Shock therapy for depression

## Lecture 3 - Jan 9th

**Socio-Political Context of the 20th Century**

- asylums in EU, NA and Middle East
    - increase # of patients
    - minimal effectiveness
    - short on staff
- WW1 & WW2
    - Discovery of Neuroleptics; calmed people down, removed hallucinations
    - Declaration of Human Rights
- Scientific Method
    - Genetics: DNA discovered by F. Crick & J. Watson
    - Brain Imaging: Egaz Moniz

**Development of DSM-5**

- 13 panels with 15 members
- All proposals reviewed by Scientific Review Committee and Public Health Committee
- Goals: make diagnostics evidence based, incr
ease access to treatment, clarify overlapping categories

**More Terminology**

- Presenting Problem: what's observable and reportable

**Criticism of Psychiatry**

- Nellie Bly (Elizabeth Cohrane): "Ten days in a mad house"
    - faked insanity and got into a facility
    - stopped faking symptoms as soon as got admitted and was subjected to waterboarding
- David Rosenhan: "Sane in insane places"
    - 8 pseudo-patients experiment (5 men, 3 women)
    - No psychiatrists suspected they were faking
    - Several patients suspected that they were faking
    - Longest stay was 52 days

**Thomas Szasz**

- Denied the reality of mental illness; romanticized psychosis

### The Era of Scientific Method: Roadmap

- Pavlov & Behaviourism
- Social Learning: Bandura (under behavioural in the textbook)
- Neurology, Freud and psychoanalysis
- Maslow and Humanism
- Bandura and Social Learning

**Ivan Pavlov**

- Introduced conditioned response (classical conditioning)
- Nobel prize for medicine/physiology

**Mechanisms**

- Generalization: tendency of new stimulus to produce a similar response
- Discrimination: response to some stimulus but not others
- Extinction: weakening of the CR in the absence of the US (not feeding dog weakens dog salivating when bell heard)
- Reacquisition: reintroduction of US second acquisition is faster

## Lecture 4 - Jan 11th

### Behaviourism

**John B Watson**

- Little Albert, formation of phobia in a healthy infant
- Scared of furry objects

**B.F. Skinner**

- Operant conditioning: learning through reward and punishment (does not need to be biological)
- Changing behaviour using reinforcement after the desired response
- Positive reinforcement: add pleasant stimulus, Negative reinforcement: absence of unpleasant stimulus
- Punishment: add unpleasant stimulus

### Social Constructivism

**Bandura**

- Behaviour can be learned in the absence of reinforcement
- Learning requires more than trials and errors
- Sometimes can just learn through observation, other times need attention, retention, reproduction
- Bobo doll: children watching adults play with a doll aggressively did the same when they interacted with the doll

### Psychoanalysis

**Freud**

- Key ideas: dynamic unconsciousness, internal conflicts,
- Personality: id, ego, superego,
- Focused on the preconscious and subconscious processes

**Defense Mechanisms**

- If conflict is too great, problem goes to unconscious processes
- Anna Freud expanded this idea, George Vaillant classified levels 1 to 4,
- Helpful when grieving
- Examples:
    - repression, reaction formation (idolize someone you hate), regression, rationalization

### Humanism

**Abraham Maslow**

- studies monkeys and attachments
- discouraged by behaviourists
- behaviour defined by needs

### Cognitive Theories & Behavioural Therapy

**Albert Ellis: Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy**

- Considered the grandfather of cog therapy
- Irrational beliefs are mechanisms psychopathology
- Method: confronting irrational beliefs, believing that people think they are being rational
- If we can change irrational beliefs then we can treat people

**Aaron Beck: Cognitive Therapy**

- Grandfather \#2
- Developed the term of schema,
- Schema and automatic thoughts that lead to cognitive distortions
- Method: accessing cognitive content of upsetting experience, restructuring of underlying "core schema"
- Ex: thinking "I'm stupid, I never do anything right", asks if they can behave differently
- Goal to change behavioural aspect that follows the thought
- Worked with clients with depression
- **Cognitive Triad**:
    - Distorted thinking and rigid schemas cause negative views
    - Negative view of self, others and future
    - hopelessness and helplessness

## Jan 13th - Lecture 5

**Donald Meichenbaum: Cognitive Behaviour Modification**

- **Stress inoculation Training**:
    - focuses on stress and how people respond
    - how to prepare people for stressful events (instead of acting reactively)
    - skill acquisition and rehearsal: teaches specific behavioural response and coping skills
- Worked with a lot of soldiers + military men
- Focused in preventing violence and anger issues

**Case of Charly**

- 15 y/o with heart palpitations, butterflies in the stomach 2 times a day, not gastro-intestinal pathology
- Smell of the gym makes it worse
- Behaviourist: What are the US, CS CR? US = Smell of the gym, UR = possible nausea, CS = Gym, CR = nausea
- psychoanalysis: what mechanisms underlie these symptoms? Repression + Denial: Charly unable to accept something, causes him to get nausea
- cognitive therapist: what processes could be present? Looking for automatic thoughts: "I'm going to get sick, I have gastritis"

**Diagnostic Structure of DSM**

- No treatment guidelines
- Contains 19 categories
- Specify criteria for categories and threshold/cut-offs for symptoms

## Chapter 2 : Summary

- Move toward the etiology of mental health problems
- Theories gain strength not because of their evidence but because others are rejected
- Biological views: brain dysfunction, neurotransmitters or hormonal problems can cause psychological problems
- Freud and psychodynamics suggest behaviour controlled by unconscious


## Chapter 3 : Summary

- Diagnostic systems exist to provide:
  - descriptions of mental disorders, distinguishing between them and providing vocabulary
  - effective treatment depends on classification
- Many believe that DSM-5 aligns too closely with the medical model and creates stigmatization and loss of information

## Jan 16th - Lecture 6

- Recall: Chary 15 y/o example
- Does gender matter? Kind of, some things happen more frequently in males / females

**Gender Bias: DSM, training and society**

- Some have gender bias, ex: ADHD more likely in boys, girs diagnosed at later age
- Possible bias: Majority of children are raised by female educators so "normal" could be biased
- Higher prevalence in boys vs girls:
    - ADHD, ODD, Autism, Tourette

**Cultural Bias in DSM**

- Higher prevalence in minorities
    - psychosis among african american men
    - lower rates of depression among black/hispanic
- Culture-specific syndromes:
    - Japan: fear of harming and offending others
    - Attack of nerves (Peurto Rico): uncontrollable screaming, crying, trembling, sensations of heat rising in chest and head

**Criticism of DSM**

- Empirical Criticism: defined by expert committees, not by the phenomena
- Political: Only people with a diagnosis have access to services
- Humanitarian: Labelled, totalized, segregated
- Pragmatic: personal context are de-emphasised, "cultural blindness"

**Nature, Nurture, Genetics**

## Jan 18th - MISSED LECTURE

## Jan 20th

Psychopathology and Law

- **unfit to stand trial**: unable to due mental disorder to defend against charges that they're facing
- Process of acssssment:
    - Stage 1: judge decides whether there is a need for the evaluation
    - Stage 2: assessment of mental state
    - Stage 3: brief hearing to determine fitness to proceed with the trial
- **Not criminally responsible on account of Mental Disorder**
    - not guilty by reason of insanity
    - at the time, they were so deranged that they did no not know the nature of their actions
