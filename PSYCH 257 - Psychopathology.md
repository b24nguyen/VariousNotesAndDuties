# Psych 207 - Psychopathology

## Lecture 1: Jan 04

**Psychopathology:** Study of mental disorders

**Definitions**

- Psychological abnormality: A breakdown in cognitive, emotional, or behavioral function
- Mental illness ~= Psychological abnormality
- Psychopathology has 2 meanings
    - the study of psychological and behavioral dysfunction
    - specific problems faced by people with abnormality
- Psychological disorder: the manifestation of a psych abnormality that meets specific criteria set by experts. Syndrome is a group of symptoms that consistently occur together or a condition characterized by a set of symptoms

**Abnormality**

- not clearly defined: no boundaries between normal and abnormality
- many are defined culturally (Homosexuality)
- Criteria proposed:
    - **Statistical criteria** ("unusual" criteria does not always work), highly talented individuals that are abnormal do not have a mental disorder
    - **Personal distress**: some mental disorders don't provide mental distress
    - **Dysfunction** (evolutionary or adaptive perspective)
- Examples:
    - **Pedophilia**: does not meet any of the criteria and acceptable in some cultures. Based on the need to protect those who are at risk for abuse / can't defend themselves
    - **Homosexuality**: removed from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders in 1973
    - **Intellectual Disability**:

## Lecture 2: Jan 06

**Mind, Body and Soul**

- Are they different, are they the same? do they exist and are they mutually exclusive or intertwined

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Greek Tradition)**

- Socrates and Plato:
    - Rationalism
    - Inner voice
- Hippocrates
    - 4 humours related to 4 body fluids (yellow & black bile, blood phlegm)
    - sanguine (optimistic and social)
    - choleric (short-tempered or irritable)
    - melancholic (analytical and quiet)
    - phlegmatic (relaxed and peaceful)
    - Thought mental illness is an imbalance in the body
    - Concepts of melancholia and manic-depression

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Arab Tradition)**

- Avicenna
    - Traveled and created a large textbook called: The Canon of Medicine
    - Attempted to connect mental illness to the body
    - Created asylums that could take care of the mentally ill

**Dark Ages of the Middle Ages**

- Christianity: mental illness was a moral issue, religious and political tool
- Madness was a consequence of sinning
- Seen as demonic influence and possession
- Witch hunts during European wars and in the New World (Salem, MA)

**Renee Descartes**

- One of the most influential thinkers
- **Cogito ergo sum**: I think, therefore I am
- **Cartesian Dualism**:
    - universe is both mind and matter
    - The dualism still debated

**From Ancient thought to Psychiatry**

- Ideas of the body-mind connection
- Asylums to hide people away

**Enlightenment (18th Century)**

- Phillipe Pinel (France)
    - Started to care for the mentally ill, introduced moral therapy and compassion
    - Chief physician
    - Proposed individualized treatment and humane approach to mentally ill
    - Didn't last long, went back to locking up the mentally ill
- Benjamin Rush
    - Founder of American Psychiatry
    - Advocated of good treatment (clean environment w personal hygiene)
    - Rotational Therapy - imbalance in the brain so just spin them so it balances out

**Biological Tradition**

- Emil Kraepelin
    - Thought if you classified symptoms well enough then you could treat them properly
    - Symptoms that occur together often can be called a disease
    - Created basis of classification systems

- Egas Moniz
    - Nobel prize for discovery of lobotomy as a treatment for psychosis
    - One of the only available treatments until 1950s, despite severe side effect
    - Separated prefrontal cortex from other parts of the brain even though they became brain dead/ numb

**Medical Biological Model (modern)**

- International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11):
    - Focused on prevention and reduction of burden
    - Not only mental disorders, all kinds of diseases and disorders
    - Very cheap, across the world
- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
    - Used in NA
    - Originated in USA
    - Specific to psychopathology
    - Defines symptoms and treatment

## Chapter 1 : Summary

- Statistical (frequency), Personal Distress, Personal Dysfunction (interferes with functioning), Violation of Social Norms, Experts all attempt to classify abnormal behaviour
- Prehistoric times: thought it was supernatural
- Greeks and Romans thought they were biological causes
- Arabs treated it humanely with environmental and psychological factors emphasized
- Middle Ages, thought it was demons
- Lobotomies to treat mental disorders
- Shock therapy for depression

## Lecture 3 - Jan 9th

**Socio-Political Context of the 20th Century**

- asylums in EU, NA and Middle East
    - increase # of patients
    - minimal effectiveness
    - short on staff
- WW1 & WW2
    - Discovery of Neuroleptics; calmed people down, removed hallucinations
    - Declaration of Human Rights
- Scientific Method
    - Genetics: DNA discovered by F. Crick & J. Watson
    - Brain Imaging: Egaz Moniz

**Development of DSM-5**

- 13 panels with 15 members
- All proposals reviewed by Scientific Review Committee and Public Health Committee
- Goals: make diagnostics evidence based, incr
ease access to treatment, clarify overlapping categories

**More Terminology**

- Presenting Problem: what's observable and reportable

**Criticism of Psychiatry**

- Nellie Bly (Elizabeth Cohrane): "Ten days in a mad house"
    - faked insanity and got into a facility
    - stopped faking symptoms as soon as got admitted and was subjected to waterboarding
- David Rosenhan: "Sane in insane places"
    - 8 pseudo-patients experiment (5 men, 3 women)
    - No psychiatrists suspected they were faking
    - Several patients suspected that they were faking
    - Longest stay was 52 days

**Thomas Szasz**

- Denied the reality of mental illness; romanticized psychosis

### The Era of Scientific Method: Roadmap

- Pavlov & Behaviourism
- Social Learning: Bandura (under behavioural in the textbook)
- Neurology, Freud and psychoanalysis
- Maslow and Humanism
- Bandura and Social Learning

**Ivan Pavlov**

- Introduced conditioned response (classical conditioning)
- Nobel prize for medicine/physiology

**Mechanisms**

- Generalization: tendency of new stimulus to produce a similar response
- Discrimination: response to some stimulus but not others
- Extinction: weakening of the CR in the absence of the US (not feeding dog weakens dog salivating when bell heard)
- Reacquisition: reintroduction of US second acquisition is faster

## Lecture 4 - Jan 11th

### Behaviourism

**John B Watson**

- Little Albert, formation of phobia in a healthy infant
- Scared of furry objects

**B.F. Skinner**

- Operant conditioning: learning through reward and punishment (does not need to be biological)
- Changing behaviour using reinforcement after the desired response
- Positive reinforcement: add pleasant stimulus, Negative reinforcement: absence of unpleasant stimulus
- Punishment: add unpleasant stimulus

### Social Constructivism

**Bandura**

- Behaviour can be learned in the absence of reinforcement
- Learning requires more than trials and errors
- Sometimes can just learn through observation, other times need attention, retention, reproduction
- Bobo doll: children watching adults play with a doll aggressively did the same when they interacted with the doll

### Psychoanalysis

**Freud**

- Key ideas: dynamic unconsciousness, internal conflicts,
- Personality: id, ego, superego,
- Focused on the preconscious and subconscious processes

**Defense Mechanisms**

- If conflict is too great, problem goes to unconscious processes
- Anna Freud expanded this idea, George Vaillant classified levels 1 to 4,
- Helpful when grieving
- Examples:
    - repression, reaction formation (idolize someone you hate), regression, rationalization

### Humanism

**Abraham Maslow**

- studies monkeys and attachments
- discouraged by behaviourists
- behaviour defined by needs

### Cognitive Theories & Behavioural Therapy

**Albert Ellis: Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy**

- Considered the grandfather of cog therapy
- Irrational beliefs are mechanisms psychopathology
- Method: confronting irrational beliefs, believing that people think they are being rational
- If we can change irrational beliefs then we can treat people

**Aaron Beck: Cognitive Therapy**

- Grandfather \#2
- Developed the term of schema,
- Schema and automatic thoughts that lead to cognitive distortions
- Method: accessing cognitive content of upsetting experience, restructuring of underlying "core schema"
- Ex: thinking "I'm stupid, I never do anything right", asks if they can behave differently
- Goal to change behavioural aspect that follows the thought
- Worked with clients with depression
- **Cognitive Triad**:
    - Distorted thinking and rigid schemas cause negative views
    - Negative view of self, others and future
    - hopelessness and helplessness

## Jan 13th - Lecture 5

**Donald Meichenbaum: Cognitive Behaviour Modification**

- **Stress inoculation Training**:
    - focuses on stress and how people respond
    - how to prepare people for stressful events (instead of acting reactively)
    - skill acquisition and rehearsal: teaches specific behavioural response and coping skills
- Worked with a lot of soldiers + military men
- Focused in preventing violence and anger issues

**Case of Charly**

- 15 y/o with heart palpitations, butterflies in the stomach 2 times a day, not gastro-intestinal pathology
- Smell of the gym makes it worse
- Behaviourist: What are the US, CS CR? US = Smell of the gym, UR = possible nausea, CS = Gym, CR = nausea
- psychoanalysis: what mechanisms underlie these symptoms? Repression + Denial: Charly unable to accept something, causes him to get nausea
- cognitive therapist: what processes could be present? Looking for automatic thoughts: "I'm going to get sick, I have gastritis"

**Diagnostic Structure of DSM**

- No treatment guidelines
- Contains 19 categories
- Specify criteria for categories and threshold/cut-offs for symptoms

## Chapter 2 : Summary

- Move toward the etiology of mental health problems
- Theories gain strength not because of their evidence but because others are rejected
- Biological views: brain dysfunction, neurotransmitters or hormonal problems can cause psychological problems
- Freud and psychodynamics suggest behaviour controlled by unconscious


## Chapter 3 : Summary

- Diagnostic systems exist to provide:
  - descriptions of mental disorders, distinguishing between them and providing vocabulary
  - effective treatment depends on classification
- Many believe that DSM-5 aligns too closely with the medical model and creates stigmatization and loss of information

## Jan 16th - Lecture 6

- Recall: Chary 15 y/o example
- Does gender matter? Kind of, some things happen more frequently in males / females

**Gender Bias: DSM, training and society**

- Some have gender bias, ex: ADHD more likely in boys, girs diagnosed at later age
- Possible bias: Majority of children are raised by female educators so "normal" could be biased
- Higher prevalence in boys vs girls:
    - ADHD, ODD, Autism, Tourette

**Cultural Bias in DSM**

- Higher prevalence in minorities
    - psychosis among african american men
    - lower rates of depression among black/hispanic
- Culture-specific syndromes:
    - Japan: fear of harming and offending others
    - Attack of nerves (Peurto Rico): uncontrollable screaming, crying, trembling, sensations of heat rising in chest and head

**Criticism of DSM**

- Empirical Criticism: defined by expert committees, not by the phenomena
- Political: Only people with a diagnosis have access to services
- Humanitarian: Labeled, totalized, segregated
- Pragmatic: personal context are de-emphasised, "cultural blindness"

**Nature, Nurture, Genetics**

## Jan 18th

**Stigma and Mental Illness**

- Despite high prevalence of MI in population, stigma remains
- Efforts to deal with stigma (Bell Let's Talk)

**Integrative models: Diathesis-Stress Model**

- Environmental stress interacts with genetics to predict mental disorders
- Predisposition to mental disorder from stress that we may never trigger unless we accumulate enough stressors to cross our threshold
- The more predisposed you are at birth means you're closer to your tipping point

**Reciprocal Gene-Environment Model**

- Environmental stress mediates the effect of genetics on Psychopathology
- Claims that people with genetic predisposition to a disorder may have a genetic tendency to create environmental risk factors that promote that disorder. Ex: people predisposed to depression may have a tendency to get into bad relationships.

**Integrative Model: Biopsychosocial Model**

- Attributes disease outcome to the intricate, variable interaction of the following factors:
- Bio: genetic vulnerability, sleep deprivation
- Psych: challenging beliefs about self as weird, a burder, self awareness and self-compassion
- Social: availability of support, social activities, social skills

**Biopsychosocial model of Psychopathology?**

- Biological basis for violence
    - Lobrosso's theory of born criminals
    - minor physical anomamlies (frontal lobe + amygdala)
- Neurolaw & Criminology
    - Biological risk combined with environmental & social risk
    - Studies suggest that the anatomy of brain (prefrontal cortex) can make individuals more prone to violence

**Assessment Methods**

- Clinical: Interview, projective, cognitive
- Neuropsychological: Traditionally assessed impairment of specific brain structure
- Many others

## Jan 20th

### Psychopathology and Law

- **Unfit to stand trial**: unable to due mental disorder to defend against charges that they're facing
- Process of assessment:
    - Stage 1: judge decides whether there is a need for the evaluation
    - Stage 2: assessment of mental state
    - Stage 3: brief hearing to determine fitness to proceed with the trial
- **Not criminally responsible on account of Mental Disorder (NCRMD)**
    - not guilty by reason of insanity
    - at the time, they were so deranged that they did no not know the nature of their actions

**Decisions based on Criminal Insanity**

- Outcomes of NCRMD
    - Ordered to receive treatment
    - Detained in hospital
    - Release from hospital

**Duty to Protect/Duty to Warn**

- Clinician's obligation to protect society from potentially dangerous patients
- (If they tell you, they're going to do something horrible then you can break doc-patient confidentiality)

**Civil Commitment**

- Permits commitment when the following three commitments have been met:
    - Diagnosed with mental illness
    - Deemed dangerous to self or others.
    - The person is in need of treatment

## Jan 23rd

**Sam Yatin case**

- 18 y/o with mental illness
- held a knife, killed by police while being non-threatening

**Police-PMI Encounters**

- 5% of calls involve someone with mental illness, others report 31%
- Mentally ill have 3x greater risk to have police contact
- PMI have repeated occurrences with police + have higher arrest rates
- 60% police-PMI-interactions involve criminal behavior
- Not a violent interaction

**Mental illness related to violence: Schizophrenia**

- Delusions + hallucinations
- Persecutory/Threat Delusion: belief of being followed, harassed, spied on
- Control Override Delusion: False belief that another person controls one's thoughts, feelings or behavior

**Mood Disorders**

- Major depression: painful state of extreme anguish, sadness, worthlessness, suicidal ideation
- Bipolar Disorder: Depression and euphoria (mania), talkative, less need for sleep, buying sprees, recklessness

**Rise in Police-PMI contact**

- Stigma of PMI as dangerous and unpredictable
    - risk of violence is 50% (more likely to commit violence)
    - Media Sensationalization: Media loves violent mentally ill people
- Deinstitutionalization of MH treatment
    - Advent of psychotropic medication
    - Lower psychiatric hospital beds capacity
- Inadequacy of community MH treatment model
    - underfunded
- Reforms in mental health legislation
    - provincial mental health act
    stricter civil commitment criteria

**SYSTEMS THEORY**

- Limited access to MH care + public perception of danger + high visibility = police call
- Police often called upon to assist people displaying erratic or bizarre behavior
- People trying to access mental health care, police are the first line of mental health care

**Police Decision Making**

- Play pivotal role in outcome that involve PMI
- Response options:
    - MHA apprehension
    - Arrest and/or Charge
    - Informal resolution (warning)
    - Divert to the MH system

## Jan 25th

**Rorschach Test**

- Developed by Hermann Rorschach
- Inkblot test, subjects' perceptions are recorded and analysed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms or both
- Used to examine personality and emotional functioning
- Used when patients are reluctant to describe their thought processes openly

**Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)**

- Developed by Henry Murray & Christiana Morgan @ Harvard University
- 32 ambiguous cards with intention to provoke an emotional response. 10-20 chosen for each patient
- Idea that people interpret ambiguity in accordance to their own past experiences or current motivations, conscious or unconscious
- Asked to provide:
    - What has led up to the event shown
    - what is happening at the moment
    - what the characters are feeling
    - what the outcome of the story was

**Mental Status Exam (MSE)**

- Key part of the initial psychiatric assessment in an out-patient (less than 24 hours) or psychiatric hospital setting
- purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders at the time of the interview
1. Appearance and Behaviour: unusual actions, is clothing appropriate for season/age/occasion
2. Thought process:
    - rate and flow of speech
    - clarity and content of speech and ideas
    - speed of thought (time between thought and verbal expression)
    - racing thoughts (thoughts in a seamless fashion, often in a list form, associated with anxiety and manic states (bipolar))
3. Mood and affect: Low mood vs euphoric, affect and mood appropriate or inappropriate
4. Intellectual functioning: does the client have a reasonable vocabulary and memory
5. Sensorium: General awareness of surroundings such as date, place, time knowledge of self
6. Attention: Distractible, preoccupied, rumination
7. Affect & Mood: congruent (genuine mood, appropriate emotional expression to the content) / incongruent (inauthentic, superficial, inappropriate emotional response)

**Personality Assessment (MMPI)**

- Developed at University of Minnesota Hospitals
- Composed of 567 T/F questions, short form is 370 questions
- Version for adolescents 14-18 y/o: MMPI-A
- 10 major categories of abnormal human behaviour
- 4 validity scales
    - cannot say scale - number of omitted items
    - L scale: attempt to present oneself in a favorable light
    - F scale: detect deviant or atypical ways of responding to test items
    - K scale: subtle index: "defensive scale" attempts to deny psychopathology

**Interpersonal Assessment**

- important in assessment of personality disorders, family therapy and group therapy
- Contempt: passive aggressive style of relating to others, mocking vocal tone
- Defensive: responding to others in a hostile manner
- Dismissive: responding with disregard for others input, think they know better
- Guarded: overly careful about sharing information, lack of trust

**Assessment of disorders**

- Neuropsychological: carried out to assess impairment of specific brain structure, focus on cognition and behaviour
    - Non verbal reasoning,
    - Visual-Motor integration (copy image)
    - Stroop test (interference): coloured words
- Psychoeducational: learning disabilities
- Neuroimaging: Cat scan, MRI, PET scan, fMRI, etc

### Research Methods

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**

- observed differences or relationships merely result from chance errors inherent in sampling processes
- rejuect null hypothesis for research hypothesis

**Reliability**

- Test-retest reliability: able to retest with different individuals
    - Since patients can get better at the test after taking it once, you need alternate-form reliability to produce a 2nd test that offers the same ultility
- Parallel reliability: administer different versions of an assessment
- inter-rater reliability: comparing the degree to which different raters agree in their assessment
- Internal consistency reliability: evaluate the degree to which different test items that probe the same construct produce similar results

**Validity**

- Internal validity: The degree to which the changes in the dependent vars are a result of the manip in the indep vars
- External validity: the findings apply to other individuals in other settings
- Face validity: appears to measure what it states to measure
- Content validity: test's content include representative sample of all relate behaviours (ex: Depression assessment looks at sadness, lack of energy etc)
- Construct validity: is actually measuring what it is intending to and not other vars
- Criterion validity: reflects how a measure is related to the outcome. (ex: A art test with high marks from only art students has high criterion validity)
- Sampling validity: test covers a broad range of areas within the concept under study

## Jan 27th    

### Anxiety disorders

- most common group of disorders
- Evolutionary perspective:
    - safety mechanism to danger
    - over time impairs the normal day to day functioning, can have profound impact on learning
- Fear response, as it stays, it becomes an anxious state
- Negative mood state: worrying about negative outcomes
- Future focused: what if, sense of lack of control

**When does it become a disorder?**

- Dysfunction: pervasive and persistent symptoms of anxiety and fear
- Deviance: Excessive avoidance and escapist tendencies
- Distress: Clinically significant distress or impairment

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

- Excessive anxiety and **worry** about a range of events or activities, can change from one day to another
- Difficulty controlling worries
- Somatic symptoms: muscle tension, fatigue, irritability
- At least 3 physical symptoms: restlessness, fatigued, impaired concentration, irritability, muscle aches, difficulty sleeping

**Different theories of Anxiety**

- Intolerance of Uncertainty: It's okay to not be certain of outcomes
- Emotion Regulation: People regulate their emotions differently
- Cognitive avoidance: Worrying is a defense mechanism to avoid conflict

**Challenges with GAD**

- moving target for therapists and patients
- worries keep changing and nobody knows what it will be

**Treatment of GAD**

- Medication:
    - Benzodiazapenes: effective short term relief, no evidence of long term benefits, physical and psychological dependence
    - Need to be switched off, only meant for short-term relief
- Psychotherapy
    - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
    - Mindfulness Based Therapy

**Panic Disorder**

- Recurrent unexpected panic attacks
- One attack followed by
    - 1 month (or more) of one or both
    - concern or worry about subsequent attacks
    - Maladaptive behavioural chnages related to attacks

**Agarophobia**

- Fear of public spaces and closed spaces
- Standing in line or being in a crowd
- Being outside of the home alone

## Feb 1

**1st test stuff**

- look at uptake of medications, (ch 2)

**Major Depressive Disorder**

- No history of mania or hypomania
- Major depressive episode -> MDD single episode OR -> MDD Recurrent
- Dysthymia, persistent mild depression, lasts a long time
- If you have both -> DOUBLE DEPRESSION, happens quite often for those that suffer from recurrent MDD

**Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**

- Depressed mood most of the days, more days than not for at least 2 years
- Presence while depressed of 2 or more of:
    - poor appetite
    - insomnia or hypersomnia
    - low energy or fatigue
    - low self-esteem
    - poor concentration or difficulty making decisions
    - feelings of hopelessness

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

- Onset before age 10
- Mood fluctuates often for children (can't be an adult)
- irritability displayed as temper tantrums that occur frequently
- far beyond temper tantrums, out of proportion
- diagnosis between 6-18 y/o

**Causes of Mood Disorders**

- Biological
    - Genetic influences
    - neurotransmitters (has genetic component too), 3 neurotransmitters (serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine), attack on serotonin seems to be the most effective.
    - Most effective anti depressants use SSRI to inhibit serotonin uptake (blocking receptors)
    - endocrine system
    - People that work night shifts at higher risk (sleep & circadian rhythms)
- Social and cultural dimensions
    - (Not only creating, but coping with disorders)
    - Martial relations
    - Gender roles
    - Social support
- Cultural beliefs

##  Chapter 5 Summary - Anxiety and related disorders

- 3 components of emotion (and stress):
    - Physiology: increase heart rate and breathing
    - Cognition: bad thoughts "I'm dumb"
    - Behaviour: trying to avoid the trigger
- Etiological models of anxiety disorder & phobias:
    - Two-factor theory (conditioning): negative stimulus gets paired with neutral stimulus
    - Equipotentiality premise: Idea that all neutral stimulus have equal prob to become phobias
    - nonassociative model: process of evolution gives you these fears (too dangerous to learn to fear them)

## Chapter 8 Summary - Mood Disorders & Suicide

- Depressive disorders include MDD and Dysthymia
- MDD symptoms: 5 must be present for at least 2 weeks
- Persistent depression last for >= 2 years + 2 depressive symptoms
- Cognitive Models: focus on negative thoughts and negative schema about self/world/future
- Interpersonal: heightened risk for interpersonal conflict and rejections trigger depression
- Biological Models:
    - Genetics: predisposed to anxiety
    - Neurotransmitters: Serotonin transporter gene in heightened sensitivity to stressful life events
