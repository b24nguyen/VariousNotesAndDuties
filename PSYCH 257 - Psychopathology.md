# Psych 207 - Psychopathology

## Lecture 1: Jan 04

**Psychopathology:** Study of mental disorders

**Definitions**

- Psychological abnormality: A breakdown in cognitive, emotional, or behavioral function
- Mental illness ~= Psychological abnormality
- Psychopathology has 2 meanings
    - the study of psychological and behavioral dysfunction
    - specific problems faced by people with abnormality
- Psychological disorder: the manifestation of a psych abnormality that meets specific criteria set by experts. Syndrome is a group of symptoms that consistently occur together or a condition characterized by a set of symptoms

**Abnormality**

- not clearly defined: no boundaries between normal and abnormality
- many are defined culturally (Homosexuality)
- Criteria proposed:
    - **Statistical criteria** ("unusual" criteria does not always work), highly talented individuals that are abnormal do not have a mental disorder
    - **Personal distress**: some mental disorders don't provide mental distress
    - **Dysfunction** (evolutionary or adaptive perspective)
- Examples:
    - **Pedophilia**: does not meet any of the criteria and acceptable in some cultures. Based on the need to protect those who are at risk for abuse / can't defend themselves
    - **Homosexuality**: removed from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders in 1973
    - **Intellectual Disability**:

## Lecture 2: Jan 06

**Mind, Body and Soul**

- Are they different, are they the same? do they exist and are they mutually exclusive or intertwined

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Greek Tradition)**

- Socrates and Plato:
    - Rationalism
    - Inner voice
- Hippocrates
    - 4 humours related to 4 body fluids (yellow & black bile, blood phlegm)
    - sanguine (optimistic and social)
    - choleric (short-tempered or irritable)
    - melancholic (analytical and quiet)
    - phlegmatic (relaxed and peaceful)
    - Thought mental illness is an imbalance in the body
    - Concepts of melancholia and manic-depression

**Ancient Theories of Soul (Arab Tradition)**

- Avicenna
    - Traveled and created a large textbook called: The Canon of Medicine
    - Attempted to connect mental illness to the body
    - Created asylums that could take care of the mentally ill

**Dark Ages of the Middle Ages**

- Christianity: mental illness was a moral issue, religious and political tool
- Madness was a consequence of sinning
- Seen as demonic influence and possession
- Witch hunts during European wars and in the New World (Salem, MA)

**Renee Descartes**

- One of the most influential thinkers
- **Cogito ergo sum**: I think, therefore I am
- **Cartesian Dualism**:
    - universe is both mind and matter
    - The dualism still debated

**From Ancient thought to Psychiatry**

- Ideas of the body-mind connection
- Asylums to hide people away

**Enlightenment (18th Century)**

- Phillipe Pinel (France)
    - Started to care for the mentally ill, introduced moral therapy and compassion
    - Chief physician
    - Proposed individualized treatment and humane approach to mentally ill
    - Didn't last long, went back to locking up the mentally ill
- Benjamin Rush
    - Founder of American Psychiatry
    - Advocated of good treatment (clean environment w personal hygiene)
    - Rotational Therapy - imbalance in the brain so just spin them so it balances out

**Biological Tradition**

- Emil Kraepelin
    - Thought if you classified symptoms well enough then you could treat them properly
    - Symptoms that occur together often can be called a disease
    - Created basis of classification systems

- Egas Moniz
    - Nobel prize for discovery of lobotomy as a treatment for psychosis
    - One of the only available treatments until 1950s, despite severe side effect
    - Separated prefrontal cortex from other parts of the brain even though they became brain dead/ numb

**Medical Biological Model (modern)**

- International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11):
    - Focused on prevention and reduction of burden
    - Not only mental disorders, all kinds of diseases and disorders
    - Very cheap, across the world
- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
    - Used in NA
    - Originated in USA
    - Specific to psychopathology
    - Defines symptoms and treatment

## Chapter 1 : Summary

- Statistical (frequency), Personal Distress, Personal Dysfunction (interferes with functioning), Violation of Social Norms, Experts all attempt to classify abnormal behaviour
- Prehistoric times: thought it was supernatural
- Greeks and Romans thought they were biological causes
- Arabs treated it humanely with environmental and psychological factors emphasized
- Middle Ages, thought it was demons
- Lobotomies to treat mental disorders
- Shock therapy for depression

## Lecture 3 - Jan 9th

**Socio-Political Context of the 20th Century**

- asylums in EU, NA and Middle East
    - increase # of patients
    - minimal effectiveness
    - short on staff
- WW1 & WW2
    - Discovery of Neuroleptics; calmed people down, removed hallucinations
    - Declaration of Human Rights
- Scientific Method
    - Genetics: DNA discovered by F. Crick & J. Watson
    - Brain Imaging: Egaz Moniz

**Development of DSM-5**

- 13 panels with 15 members
- All proposals reviewed by Scientific Review Committee and Public Health Committee
- Goals: make diagnostics evidence based, incr
ease access to treatment, clarify overlapping categories

**More Terminology**

- Presenting Problem: what's observable and reportable

**Criticism of Psychiatry**

- Nellie Bly (Elizabeth Cohrane): "Ten days in a mad house"
    - faked insanity and got into a facility
    - stopped faking symptoms as soon as got admitted and was subjected to waterboarding
- David Rosenhan: "Sane in insane places"
    - 8 pseudo-patients experiment (5 men, 3 women)
    - No psychiatrists suspected they were faking
    - Several patients suspected that they were faking
    - Longest stay was 52 days

**Thomas Szasz**

- Denied the reality of mental illness; romanticized psychosis

### The Era of Scientific Method: Roadmap

- Pavlov & Behaviourism
- Social Learning: Bandura (under behavioural in the textbook)
- Neurology, Freud and psychoanalysis
- Maslow and Humanism
- Bandura and Social Learning

**Ivan Pavlov**

- Introduced conditioned response (classical conditioning)
- Nobel prize for medicine/physiology

**Mechanisms**

- Generalization: tendency of new stimulus to produce a similar response
- Discrimination: response to some stimulus but not others
- Extinction: weakening of the CR in the absence of the US (not feeding dog weakens dog salivating when bell heard)
- Reacquisition: reintroduction of US second acquisition is faster

## Lecture 4 - Jan 11th

### Behaviourism

**John B Watson**

- Little Albert, formation of phobia in a healthy infant
- Scared of furry objects

**B.F. Skinner**

- Operant conditioning: learning through reward and punishment (does not need to be biological)
- Changing behaviour using reinforcement after the desired response
- Positive reinforcement: add pleasant stimulus, Negative reinforcement: absence of unpleasant stimulus
- Punishment: add unpleasant stimulus

### Social Constructivism

**Bandura**

- Behaviour can be learned in the absence of reinforcement
- Learning requires more than trials and errors
- Sometimes can just learn through observation, other times need attention, retention, reproduction
- Bobo doll: children watching adults play with a doll aggressively did the same when they interacted with the doll

### Psychoanalysis

**Freud**

- Key ideas: dynamic unconsciousness, internal conflicts,
- Personality: id, ego, superego,
- Focused on the preconscious and subconscious processes

**Defense Mechanisms**

- If conflict is too great, problem goes to unconscious processes
- Anna Freud expanded this idea, George Vaillant classified levels 1 to 4,
- Helpful when grieving
- Examples:
    - repression, reaction formation (idolize someone you hate), regression, rationalization

### Humanism

**Abraham Maslow**

- studies monkeys and attachments
- discouraged by behaviourists
- behaviour defined by needs

### Cognitive Theories & Behavioural Therapy

**Albert Ellis: Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy**

- Considered the grandfather of cog therapy
- Irrational beliefs are mechanisms psychopathology
- Method: confronting irrational beliefs, believing that people think they are being rational
- If we can change irrational beliefs then we can treat people

**Aaron Beck: Cognitive Therapy**

- Grandfather \#2
- Developed the term of schema,
- Schema and automatic thoughts that lead to cognitive distortions
- Method: accessing cognitive content of upsetting experience, restructuring of underlying "core schema"
- Ex: thinking "I'm stupid, I never do anything right", asks if they can behave differently
- Goal to change behavioural aspect that follows the thought
- Worked with clients with depression
- **Cognitive Triad**:
    - Distorted thinking and rigid schemas cause negative views
    - Negative view of self, others and future
    - hopelessness and helplessness

## Jan 13th - Lecture 5

**Donald Meichenbaum: Cognitive Behaviour Modification**

- **Stress inoculation Training**:
    - focuses on stress and how people respond
    - how to prepare people for stressful events (instead of acting reactively)
    - skill acquisition and rehearsal: teaches specific behavioural response and coping skills
- Worked with a lot of soldiers + military men
- Focused in preventing violence and anger issues

**Case of Charly**

- 15 y/o with heart palpitations, butterflies in the stomach 2 times a day, not gastro-intestinal pathology
- Smell of the gym makes it worse
- Behaviourist: What are the US, CS CR? US = Smell of the gym, UR = possible nausea, CS = Gym, CR = nausea
- psychoanalysis: what mechanisms underlie these symptoms? Repression + Denial: Charly unable to accept something, causes him to get nausea
- cognitive therapist: what processes could be present? Looking for automatic thoughts: "I'm going to get sick, I have gastritis"

**Diagnostic Structure of DSM**

- No treatment guidelines
- Contains 19 categories
- Specify criteria for categories and threshold/cut-offs for symptoms

## Chapter 2 : Summary

- Move toward the etiology of mental health problems
- Theories gain strength not because of their evidence but because others are rejected
- Biological views: brain dysfunction, neurotransmitters or hormonal problems can cause psychological problems
- Freud and psychodynamics suggest behaviour controlled by unconscious


## Chapter 3 : Summary

- Diagnostic systems exist to provide:
  - descriptions of mental disorders, distinguishing between them and providing vocabulary
  - effective treatment depends on classification
- Many believe that DSM-5 aligns too closely with the medical model and creates stigmatization and loss of information

## Jan 16th - Lecture 6

- Recall: Chary 15 y/o example
- Does gender matter? Kind of, some things happen more frequently in males / females

**Gender Bias: DSM, training and society**

- Some have gender bias, ex: ADHD more likely in boys, girs diagnosed at later age
- Possible bias: Majority of children are raised by female educators so "normal" could be biased
- Higher prevalence in boys vs girls:
    - ADHD, ODD, Autism, Tourette

**Cultural Bias in DSM**

- Higher prevalence in minorities
    - psychosis among african american men
    - lower rates of depression among black/hispanic
- Culture-specific syndromes:
    - Japan: fear of harming and offending others
    - Attack of nerves (Peurto Rico): uncontrollable screaming, crying, trembling, sensations of heat rising in chest and head

**Criticism of DSM**

- Empirical Criticism: defined by expert committees, not by the phenomena
- Political: Only people with a diagnosis have access to services
- Humanitarian: Labeled, totalized, segregated
- Pragmatic: personal context are de-emphasised, "cultural blindness"

**Nature, Nurture, Genetics**

## Jan 18th

**Stigma and Mental Illness**

- Despite high prevalence of MI in population, stigma remains
- Efforts to deal with stigma (Bell Let's Talk)

**Integrative models: Diathesis-Stress Model**

- Environmental stress interacts with genetics to predict mental disorders
- Predisposition to mental disorder from stress that we may never trigger unless we accumulate enough stressors to cross our threshold
- The more predisposed you are at birth means you're closer to your tipping point

**Reciprocal Gene-Environment Model**

- Environmental stress mediates the effect of genetics on Psychopathology
- Claims that people with genetic predisposition to a disorder may have a genetic tendency to create environmental risk factors that promote that disorder. Ex: people predisposed to depression may have a tendency to get into bad relationships.

**Integrative Model: Biopsychosocial Model**

- Attributes disease outcome to the intricate, variable interaction of the following factors:
- Bio: genetic vulnerability, sleep deprivation
- Psych: challenging beliefs about self as weird, a burder, self awareness and self-compassion
- Social: availability of support, social activities, social skills

**Biopsychosocial model of Psychopathology?**

- Biological basis for violence
    - Lobrosso's theory of born criminals
    - minor physical anomamlies (frontal lobe + amygdala)
- Neurolaw & Criminology
    - Biological risk combined with environmental & social risk
    - Studies suggest that the anatomy of brain (prefrontal cortex) can make individuals more prone to violence

**Assessment Methods**

- Clinical: Interview, projective, cognitive
- Neuropsychological: Traditionally assessed impairment of specific brain structure
- Many others

## Jan 20th

### Psychopathology and Law

- **Unfit to stand trial**: unable to due mental disorder to defend against charges that they're facing
- Process of assessment:
    - Stage 1: judge decides whether there is a need for the evaluation
    - Stage 2: assessment of mental state
    - Stage 3: brief hearing to determine fitness to proceed with the trial
- **Not criminally responsible on account of Mental Disorder (NCRMD)**
    - not guilty by reason of insanity
    - at the time, they were so deranged that they did no not know the nature of their actions

**Decisions based on Criminal Insanity**

- Outcomes of NCRMD
    - Ordered to receive treatment
    - Detained in hospital
    - Release from hospital

**Duty to Protect/Duty to Warn**

- Clinician's obligation to protect society from potentially dangerous patients
- (If they tell you, they're going to do something horrible then you can break doc-patient confidentiality)

**Civil Commitment**

- Permits commitment when the following three commitments have been met:
    - Diagnosed with mental illness
    - Deemed dangerous to self or others.
    - The person is in need of treatment

## Jan 23rd

**Sam Yatin case**

- 18 y/o with mental illness
- held a knife, killed by police while being non-threatening

**Police-PMI Encounters**

- 5% of calls involve someone with mental illness, others report 31%
- Mentally ill have 3x greater risk to have police contact
- PMI have repeated occurrences with police + have higher arrest rates
- 60% police-PMI-interactions involve criminal behavior
- Not a violent interaction

**Mental illness related to violence: Schizophrenia**

- Delusions + hallucinations
- Persecutory/Threat Delusion: belief of being followed, harassed, spied on
- Control Override Delusion: False belief that another person controls one's thoughts, feelings or behavior

**Mood Disorders**

- Major depression: painful state of extreme anguish, sadness, worthlessness, suicidal ideation
- Bipolar Disorder: Depression and euphoria (mania), talkative, less need for sleep, buying sprees, recklessness

**Rise in Police-PMI contact**

- Stigma of PMI as dangerous and unpredictable
    - risk of violence is 50% (more likely to commit violence)
    - Media Sensationalization: Media loves violent mentally ill people
- Deinstitutionalization of MH treatment
    - Advent of psychotropic medication
    - Lower psychiatric hospital beds capacity
- Inadequacy of community MH treatment model
    - underfunded
- Reforms in mental health legislation
    - provincial mental health act
    stricter civil commitment criteria

**SYSTEMS THEORY**

- Limited access to MH care + public perception of danger + high visibility = police call
- Police often called upon to assist people displaying erratic or bizarre behavior
- People trying to access mental health care, police are the first line of mental health care

**Police Decision Making**

- Play pivotal role in outcome that involve PMI
- Response options:
    - MHA apprehension
    - Arrest and/or Charge
    - Informal resolution (warning)
    - Divert to the MH system

## Jan 25th

**Rorschach Test**

- Developed by Hermann Rorschach
- Inkblot test, subjects' perceptions are recorded and analysed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms or both
- Used to examine personality and emotional functioning
- Used when patients are reluctant to describe their thought processes openly

**Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)**

- Developed by Henry Murray & Christiana Morgan @ Harvard University
- 32 ambiguous cards with intention to provoke an emotional response. 10-20 chosen for each patient
- Idea that people interpret ambiguity in accordance to their own past experiences or current motivations, conscious or unconscious
- Asked to provide:
    - What has led up to the event shown
    - what is happening at the moment
    - what the characters are feeling
    - what the outcome of the story was

**Mental Status Exam (MSE)**

- Key part of the initial psychiatric assessment in an out-patient (less than 24 hours) or psychiatric hospital setting
- purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders at the time of the interview
1. Appearance and Behaviour: unusual actions, is clothing appropriate for season/age/occasion
2. Thought process:
    - rate and flow of speech
    - clarity and content of speech and ideas
    - speed of thought (time between thought and verbal expression)
    - racing thoughts (thoughts in a seamless fashion, often in a list form, associated with anxiety and manic states (bipolar))
3. Mood and affect: Low mood vs euphoric, affect and mood appropriate or inappropriate
4. Intellectual functioning: does the client have a reasonable vocabulary and memory
5. Sensorium: General awareness of surroundings such as date, place, time knowledge of self
6. Attention: Distractible, preoccupied, rumination
7. Affect & Mood: congruent (genuine mood, appropriate emotional expression to the content) / incongruent (inauthentic, superficial, inappropriate emotional response)

**Personality Assessment (MMPI)**

- Developed at University of Minnesota Hospitals
- Composed of 567 T/F questions, short form is 370 questions
- Version for adolescents 14-18 y/o: MMPI-A
- 10 major categories of abnormal human behaviour
- 4 validity scales
    - cannot say scale - number of omitted items
    - L scale: attempt to present oneself in a favorable light
    - F scale: detect deviant or atypical ways of responding to test items
    - K scale: subtle index: "defensive scale" attempts to deny psychopathology

**Interpersonal Assessment**

- important in assessment of personality disorders, family therapy and group therapy
- Contempt: passive aggressive style of relating to others, mocking vocal tone
- Defensive: responding to others in a hostile manner
- Dismissive: responding with disregard for others input, think they know better
- Guarded: overly careful about sharing information, lack of trust

**Assessment of disorders**

- Neuropsychological: carried out to assess impairment of specific brain structure, focus on cognition and behaviour
    - Non verbal reasoning,
    - Visual-Motor integration (copy image)
    - Stroop test (interference): coloured words
- Psychoeducational: learning disabilities
- Neuroimaging: Cat scan, MRI, PET scan, fMRI, etc

### Research Methods

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**

- observed differences or relationships merely result from chance errors inherent in sampling processes
- reject null hypothesis for research hypothesis

**Reliability**

- Test-retest reliability: able to retest with different individuals
    - Since patients can get better at the test after taking it once, you need alternate-form reliability to produce a 2nd test that offers the same ultility
- Parallel reliability: administer different versions of an assessment
- inter-rater reliability: comparing the degree to which different raters agree in their assessment
- Internal consistency reliability: evaluate the degree to which different test items that probe the same construct produce similar results

**Validity**

- Internal validity: The degree to which the changes in the dependent vars are a result of the manip in the indep vars
- External validity: the findings apply to other individuals in other settings
- Face validity: appears to measure what it states to measure
- Content validity: test's content include representative sample of all relate behaviours (ex: Depression assessment looks at sadness, lack of energy etc)
- Construct validity: is actually measuring what it is intending to and not other vars
- Criterion validity: reflects how a measure is related to the outcome. (ex: A art test with high marks from only art students has high criterion validity)
- Sampling validity: test covers a broad range of areas within the concept under study

## Jan 27th    

### Anxiety disorders

- most common group of disorders
- Evolutionary perspective:
    - safety mechanism to danger
    - over time impairs the normal day to day functioning, can have profound impact on learning
- Fear response, as it stays, it becomes an anxious state
- Negative mood state: worrying about negative outcomes
- Future focused: what if, sense of lack of control

**When does it become a disorder?**

- Dysfunction: pervasive and persistent symptoms of anxiety and fear
- Deviance: Excessive avoidance and escapist tendencies
- Distress: Clinically significant distress or impairment

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

- Excessive anxiety and **worry** about a range of events or activities, can change from one day to another
- Difficulty controlling worries
- Somatic symptoms: muscle tension, fatigue, irritability
- At least 3 physical symptoms: restlessness, fatigued, impaired concentration, irritability, muscle aches, difficulty sleeping

**Different theories of Anxiety**

- Intolerance of Uncertainty: It's okay to not be certain of outcomes
- Emotion Regulation: People regulate their emotions differently
- Cognitive avoidance: Worrying is a defense mechanism to avoid conflict

**Challenges with GAD**

- moving target for therapists and patients
- worries keep changing and nobody knows what it will be

**Treatment of GAD**

- Medication:
    - Benzodiazapenes: effective short term relief, no evidence of long term benefits, physical and psychological dependence
    - Need to be switched off, only meant for short-term relief
- Psychotherapy
    - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
    - Mindfulness Based Therapy

**Panic Disorder**

- Recurrent unexpected panic attacks
- One attack followed by
    - 1 month (or more) of one or both
    - concern or worry about subsequent attacks
    - Maladaptive behavioural chnages related to attacks

**Agarophobia**

- Fear of public spaces and closed spaces
- Standing in line or being in a crowd
- Being outside of the home alone

- person who can speak doesn't speak to certain people or under certain circumstances

**Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD)**

- obsessions and compulsions interfere with everyday life
- thoughts that are bad or horrible to someone else or self
- become obsessed with the thought becoming a reality: thought-action fusion
- compulsion is a treatment method to deal with their thoughts

**Anxiety vs OCD**

## Feb 1

**1st test stuff**

- look at uptake of medications, (ch 2)

**Major Depressive Disorder**

- No history of mania or hypomania
- Major depressive episode -> MDD single episode OR -> MDD Recurrent
- Dysthymia, persistent mild depression, lasts a long time
- If you have both -> DOUBLE DEPRESSION, happens quite often for those that suffer from recurrent MDD

**Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**

- Depressed mood most of the days, more days than not for at least 2 years
- Presence while depressed of 2 or more of:
    - poor appetite
    - insomnia or hypersomnia
    - low energy or fatigue
    - low self-esteem
    - poor concentration or difficulty making decisions
    - feelings of hopelessness

- does not meet criteria for mixed episode

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

- Onset before age 10
- Mood fluctuates often for children (can't be an adult)
- irritability displayed as temper tantrums that occur frequently
- far beyond temper tantrums, out of proportion
- diagnosis between 6-18 y/o

**Causes of Mood Disorders**

- Biological
    - Genetic influences
    - neurotransmitters (has genetic component too), 3 neurotransmitters (serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine), attack on serotonin seems to be the most effective.
    - Most effective anti depressants use SSRI to inhibit serotonin uptake (blocking receptors)
    - endocrine system
    - People that work night shifts at higher risk (sleep & circadian rhythms)
- Social and cultural dimensions
    - (Not only creating, but coping with disorders)
    - Martial relations
    - Gender roles
    - Social support
- Cultural beliefs

##  Chapter 5 Summary - Anxiety and related disorders

- 3 components of emotion (and stress):
    - Physiology: increase heart rate and breathing
    - Cognition: bad thoughts "I'm dumb"
    - Behaviour: trying to avoid the trigger
- Etiological models of anxiety disorder & phobias:
    - Two-factor theory (conditioning): negative stimulus gets paired with neutral stimulus
    - Equipotentiality premise: Idea that all neutral stimulus have equal prob to become phobias
    - nonassociative model: process of evolution gives you these fears (too dangerous to learn to fear them)

## Chapter 8 Summary - Mood Disorders & Suicide

- Depressive disorders include MDD and Dysthymia
- MDD symptoms: 5 must be present for at least 2 weeks
- Persistent depression last for >= 2 years + 2 depressive symptoms
- Cognitive Models: focus on negative thoughts and negative schema about self/world/future
- Interpersonal: heightened risk for interpersonal conflict and rejections trigger depression
- Biological Models:
    - Genetics: predisposed to anxiety
    - Neurotransmitters: Serotonin transporter gene in heightened sensitivity to stressful life events

    - Factitious disorder (and imposed on another, Munchausen syndrome by proxy)

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

- Diagnostic criteria
    - Disruption in identity characterized by 2 or more distinct personality states, is some cultures described as an experience in possession
    - Marked discontinuity in a sense of self, accompanied by alterations of affect, behaviour, memory, perception, cognition
    - Recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, important personal information, traumatic events
    - Symptoms may cause significant distress
- Diagnostic Features
    - Dissociative Amnesia in those with DID manifest in 3 ways:
        - Gaps in remote memory of personal life
        - Lapses in dependable memory (how to do a job)
        - Discovery of evidence of actions in everyday evens (finding objects) or dissociative fugue
    - People have various degrees of awareness
    - Often present with comorbid depression, anxiety and self-injury
    - Non-epileptic seizures are common
    - 70% have previous suicide attempts
    - Females more likely to have amnesia, flashbacks, fugues
    - Males less likely to be diagnosed, present with violent behaviours triggered by dissociative experiences in combat, prisons, assaults

**Depersonalization/Derealization**

- Diagnostic criteria
    - Depersonalization: experience of unreality, detachment or being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, body or actions
    - Derealization: experience of unreality of detachment with respect to surroundings
- Diagnostic Features
    - Detached from self (I am no one, I know I have feelings but I don't feel them, my head is filled with cotton)
    - Long-term persistent  symptoms are rare, where as transient symptoms are common
    - Depression and anxiety are common
    - Equally prevalent in men & women
    - Mean age of onset around 16, could start in childhood
    - These states could be induced by culture-specific meditation practices but a person might later lose control over those states

**Dissociative Amnesia (DA)**

- Diagnostic criteria
    - Inability to recall important autobiographical information of traumatic or stressful nature
    - Symptoms cause significant distress
    - Not better explained by dissociative personality disorder
- Diagnostic Features
    - Localized Amnesia, can't recall events specific to the circumscribed period of time
    - Selective amnesia, some events within that time period can not be recalled
    - Generalized amnesia, complete loss of memory for one's life, could be semantic or precedural knokwledge
    - Often aware of memory problems
    - Systematized amnesia, memory for specific information (family member)
    - May be accompanied by non-epileptic seizures

**Factitious Disorder**

- Person acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning or exaggerating symptoms
- Imposed on another: condition which a person deliberately produces, feigns or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in his or her care.
- Ex: Jennifer Bush was 8, hospitalized 200 times and undergone more than 40 medical procedures. Nurses became suspicious because Jennifer always seemed to get worse after visits with her mother

**Health Psychology: George Engel**

- Engel proposed Biopsychosocial model of health
    - Behaviours, thoughts and feelings may influence the physical state

**Stress Response**

- In stressful situations: hypothalamus releases CRF to pituitary gland to release ACTH, to notify adrenal gland. Andrenal cortex reduces cortisol. Medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine. This pushes the body into hyper-alertness
- Hypothalamus --CRF--> Pituitary Gland --ACTH--> Adrenal Gland --Cortisol+Adrenaline+NorAdrenaline-->

## March 20 + 24th - Neurodevelopmental disorders

**Developmental Psychopathology**

- How disorders arise and change with time
- Some models argue that skill is to be mastered before acquiring the next stages of development, without acquisition of an early skill/resolution of conflict we have:
  - Freud: psychosexual stages
  - Piaget: cognitive stages
  - Erikson: Psychosocial stages
- Models of specific psychopathologies indicate that in atypical development sequence of acquired skills might be the same or different
  - Delay/atypical development of speech, motor skils, emotions might lead to atypical order of stages when compared to a typical child
  - Biopsychosocial Model and Continuum of development and role of the environmental/social factor

**Clinical Child Psychology**

- Two main directions:
  - Adult-based approaches applied to pediatric population with modifications and acknowledgement of a changing nature of diagnosis in childhood
  - Child-specific approaches to diagnosis and treatment (Cognitive, emotional and Neuropsychological)

**DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Disorders**

- Intellectual disability
  - Specifiers are based on adaptive functioning (mild, moderate, severe)
- Specific Learning disorder
  - Reading
  - Writing
  - Math
- Communication disability
  - Language disorder
  - Childhood onset fluency disorder (stuttering)
  - Speech sound disorder
  - Social (pragmatic) communication
- Autism spectrum
  - With or Without ID
  - With or Without LD
  - With known medical or genetic condition
- ADHD
  - inattentive
  - hyperactive
  - combined
- Motor
  - Developmental coordination disorder
  - Stereotypic movement disorder
  - Tic disorders including Tourette syndrome

**Intellectual Disability**

- Hippocrates: caused by imbalances of 4 humours in the brain
- Medieval times: care was provided by monasteries
- 18-20th century: housing moved to Asylum Model, children with intellectual or behavioural abnormalities were moved away from families. "Feeble-minded" later referred to as "deficiencies of the mind"
- 1961: Mental retardation was introduced
- 2009: replaced with Intellectual Disability
- Significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning (how to function day2day life)
- Intellectual functioning generally 2 standard deviations below the mean
- Deficit in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards
- Without ongoing support adaptive deficits limit functioning

**Adaptive Functioning and Quality of Life**

- Examples of question used to assess adaptive functioning
  - Dress himself
  - Uses appropriate public bathroom
  - Orders food when in a restaurant
  - Knows home address
  - Does laundry
  - Cleans the house using a broom / vacuum cleaner
- Typical measures of adaptive functioning
  - Vineland Adaptive Behaviours Scale
  - Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System (second edition)
- Shift toward Quality of Life Paradigm (QOL)
  - Acceptance by others
  - Independence
  - Freedom
  - Freedom of choice
  - Relationships

**Etiology**

- Genetic
  - 10-50% identified as genetic abnormality
  - Down Symdrome:
    - 1 out of 800
    - Simple trisomy 21: 90% caused by extra chromosome in either sperm or egg, chromosome repeated in every cell
    - Mosiac Trisomy: 2% of cases, abnormal cell division after fertilization, only some cells have trisomy, not all.
    - Translocation Trisomy 21: 4% of cases, part of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another chromosome at conception. Carrier will not exhibit any symptoms of down syndrome because they have the correct amount of genetic material
- Teratogenic:
  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects.
    - Less severe cases go unrecognized but known prevalence is 1/750
    - Highly depends on drinking practices
  - Infectious Diseases (TORCH)
    - T: toxoplasma infection, caused by a parasite
    - O: Other infections, HEP B, syphilis etc
    - R: Rubella, contagion that causes German measies
    - C: Cytomegalovirus, known as mononucleosis. 5% of babies who contract the virus have significant developmental problems including blindness and brain damage
    - H: Herpes simplex II is a sexually transmitted disease. May remain dormant in the carrier's body. An infant can contract this virus from the mother during pregnancy or passed to the child at birth

**Example of Diagnostic Statement**

- Intellectual Disability
- Areas of impairment
  - Conceptual domain: deficits such as difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time or money with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-related expectations
  - Social domain: Compared with typically developing age-mates, the individual is immature in social interactions, communication, conversation and language are more concrete or immature than expected for age
  - Practical: May function age-appropriately with personal care but needs some support with complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers

**Brain development and brain plasticity**

- Infancy to Middle Childhood
  - Newborn's brain experience rapid grown in white matter, trillions of connections and pathways between the neurons continue to be made
- Adolescent Brain
  - Changes in limbic system, Emotional reactivity, changes in sleep cycles, emotional immaturity
  - Frontal lobe continues to develop into adulthood
  - Parietal lobe: nuances of language, analytical skills, rapid growth of complex abstract skills

**Specific Learning Disorder**

- 2-3% of population in Canada
- Definitions change based on the year/province/org
- Broadly speaking definitions require at least average intelligence, deficit in one or more areas of academic functioning and underlying processing deficit
- Different codes and diff assessments tools are based on each of the specific academic domain affected
  - Reading
  - Writing
  - Math
- Interventions and treatments will be unique to the academic difficulty
- Ex: "Dyslexia" used in the past, for LD in reading and sometimes writing
- Can go unnoticed for years, students often struggle throughout elementary and secondary resulting in low self-esteem and sense of inadequacy by adolescence
- In adolescents, complexity of academic and social demands make mild learning disability more apparent to teachers and parents but more confusing to the students
- Self-advocacy skills are needed to access services in older adolescence
- Stigma associated with disabilities might prevent adolescents from accessing support and services

**Examples of Specific Learning Disorder**

- Riley
  - Crawling @ 1, talking in full sentences @ 4
  - Knows how to read familiar words, writes name and last name, does 1 digit addition
  - Shows great pleasure in being with family and friends, enjoys cooking and gardening. Can be clumsy and easily distracted
  - Has difficulties understanding social rules
- Jordy
  - Started Crawling @ 7 months, walking at 12 months.
  - Spoke in full sentences @ 2
  - Had frequent ear infections in pre-school
  - Enjoys active sports, board games and puzzles
  - Gets easily frustrated with homework, hides books from parents and tells them there is no homework
  - When asked to read, struggles with most unfamiliar words but can do fairly well with short and familiar words
  - Excels in math and loves playing chess with parents and friends
  - Reports feeling unhappy and the dumbest kid in the class

**Dual Exceptionality - Double whammy gifted**

- From disability POV
  - Often missed by special education services as they are able to compensate learning with cognitive abilities
  - Feeling of inadequacy and frustration with inability to perform at a desired level
  - Prefer largely to work alone, unless they are working with like-minded peers and they feel supported in their academic quests
- From giftedness POV
  - Gifted with SLD more likely to not meet criteria set by school boards
  - Gifted with ADHD might be expelled or not accepted due to behaviour
  - Teachers might need additional training

**Examples of Dual Exceptionality**

- Scott:
  - Unable to dress himself, sit still or write a legible sentence
  - From an early age, able to build cities from construction blocks, able to complete complex puzzles, verbally precocious
  - Even with his disabilities able to complete school and excel at University
- John:
  - gifted in verbal abilities
  - cannot spell or write grammatically correct sentences
  - Homeschooled for several years, mostly socialized with adults so he was awkward about joining a group of peers.

**Social Communication Disorder**

- A: Persistent difficulties in social use of verbal and nonverbal communications as manifested by all of the following:
  - Deficits in using communication for social purposes (greetings and sharing information)
  - Impairment in the ability to change communication to match context (speaking differently in the classroom than on the playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult)
  - Difficulty following rules for conversation and storytelling (taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, using verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction)
  - Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly states (humor, metaphors)
- B: Deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, relationships, academic achievement or occupational performance
- C: Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental stages
- D: Symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, global developmental delay or another mental disorder

**Examples of Language Disorders**

- ex: King's Speech
- Assessment of language impairment includes the domains of:
  - Forms of language: involve phonology (sounds & patterns), morphology (how words are formed) and syntax (formation of phrases and clauses)
  - Content of language: semantics or meanings
  - Function of language: pragmatics, how language is used in different contexts
- Receptive and Expressive language refers to production and understanding of language

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**

- Must meet all criteria
- A: Persistent deficits in social communications and social interaction, not accounted for by general developmental decays and manifest by all 3 of the following
  - deficit in social-emotional reciprocity
  - deficit in non-verbal communicative behaviours used for social interaction
  - deficit in developing and maintaining relationships
- B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities as manifested by >= 2 of the following
  - Stereotyped or repetitive speech, motor movements or use of objects
  - Excessive adherence to routines, ritualized patterns of behavior, resistance to change
  - Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus
  - Hyper or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of environment
- C: early developmental stages
- D: Not attributed to another disorder

**ADHD**

- Historical Perspective: Minimal Brain Dysfunction
- Prevalence: 6-10% of population (more likely in boys)
- Additional difficulties in the domains of
  - social relationships
  - risky behaviours
  - learning (common genetic vulnerability with LD)
- Characterized by developmentall inappropriate level of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention
- Barkley R. Fundamental deficit in ADHD is one of self-control, leading to deficit in executive functioning.
- Sanuga-Barke E. Dual Pathway: Executive and motivational with independent neurophysiological mechanisms. Motivation is characterized by difficulties in delaying rewards. Implications for interventions. EF & immediate reward/consequences
- Treatment options:
  - Psychotherapy, Dietary, Stimulants
- Research on driving habits: higher rate of collisions, speeding tickets and total accidents driving history
- Fewer safe driving behaviours in the simulator than the community comparison group
- Motivation is characterized by difficulties in delaying rewards, implications for interventions: EF & immediate reward/consequences
- Health-related risks and impairments: smoking, drug abuse, accidental injury, suicide attempts

**Motor Disorders**

- Developmental coordination disorder
  - Acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills are below expected
  - Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness and slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (catching an object, using scissors, handwriting, writing a bike, other sports)
- Stereotypic movement disorder
  - non-functional motor behaviour (e.g hand waving or head banging) that markedly interferes with normal activities or results in bodily injury
- Tic disorders, tourette syndrome
  - sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalizations
  - diagnosis depends on specific presentation (both motor and vocal are required for Tourette) and length of symptoms
- Treatment: response prevention and habit reversal training

**Challenges Specific to Children & Adults**

- Meaning and implications of diagnosis
- Age of consent
  - Mental age: children with intellectual disabilities
  - Juridical system: 12-17 at the time of the offence responsible for their actions
  - Personal Health Information and Protection Act - psychological assessment falls under health information
- Responsibility vs Freedom
  - Challenging balance of freedom, protection and responsibility
- Role of peer group increases with age, some environments might become less inclusive (full inclusion in elementary schools, assistance in adulthood)
- Family dynamic changes as children get more

## March 29th - Therapy

**Pharmacological Approach**

- Treating through medication:
- Stimulants for ADHD
- Antidepressants ex: SSRI (serotonin uptake), SNRI, NDRI etc
- Antipsychotics: sever behavioural symptoms, psychotic symptoms
- Mood stabilizers (Lithium)
- Antianxiety (anxiolytic agents)
  - Barbiturates + Benziozepines

**Psychodynamic Approach**

  - Reasons to explain how people feel and behave
  - People are frequently unaware of why they feel or behave in a certain fashion
  - Discovery of unconscious conflicts is the primary goal
  - "Free Association", "Analysis of dreams" are major methods for exploring internal conflicts
  - Focusing on interpretations of transference, defense mechanisms and current symptoms
  - Trust in insight as critically important for success in therapy

**Behavioural techniques, relaxation and biofeedback**

  - Biofeedback
  - Using machines to monitor how your body reacts so you can have more control
  - Involves learning to monitor tension in each specific muscle group in the body by deliberately inducing tension in each group. Tension is released with attention paid to the contrast
  - Biofeedback: external measuring tools
  - Electronic sensors attached to the body to detect changes
  - Brings up the connection between mind and body

**CBT**

- Fear and anxiety are conditioned responses
- Behavioural components are
  - Systematic desensitization and Exposure
  - Generalization of a new response
  - Breathing, Relaxation, Progressive Muscle Relaxation
  - Response chaining and shaping
  - Differential reinforcements
- Cognitive Therapy
  - Connections between thoughts, feelings and behaviors
  - cognitive restructuring
  - Automatic thoughts and alternative thoughts 
  - Imagery and coping statements

**Humanistic and Client-Centered Therapy**

- Carl Rogers
- Focus on personal growth
- Unconditional positive regard
- Acceptance & Empathy, accept them just as they are, understand them
- Care about the person, be a person in the relationship, not just a therapist

**Emotion Focused Therapy**

- Emotion focused therapy EFT combines:
  - Person-centered therapy (rogers): acceptance & unconditional positive regard
  - Gestalt therapy: whole does not equal its parts, present moment here and now, interpretations are NOT made, but patients make their own discoveries
