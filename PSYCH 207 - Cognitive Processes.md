# PSYCH 207 - Cognitive Processes

## Module 01: History, Methods & Paradigms

### 1A: Introduction

### 1B: Antecedents of Cognitive Psychology

- Relatively recent, taking off in 1960s
- Discussions of human mind date back to Aristotle and Plato
- 17th & 18th century: philosophers began to seriously debate the nature of human mind and knowledge 2 central traditions emerged:

**Empiricism**

- Supporters: David Locke, John Hume, Stuart Mill
- knowledge comes from an individual's own experience (all knowledge must be acquired from observation and analysis)
- Humans are born with a blank slate, all cognitive abilities and knowledge are though to be acquired through interactions with their environment

**Nativism**

- Supporters: Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kent
- Biological & genetic factors determine cognitive abilities
- Individual differences attributed to innate abilities people are born with, that is, cognitive process are hardwired in the brain and hard to modify with experience

**WIlhelm Wundt: Founding Date of cog psy (1879) **

- Wilhelm Wundt founded the first institute for research in experimental psych
- Wundt's primary goal was discover elemental components of the human mind (building blocks to conscious experience)
- referred to as **Structuralism**
- Convinced the proper setting for experiments was in a lab

**James Baldwin: First Experimental Psych in NA, UoT (1889)**

- Primary experimental method was **introspection**
- Provide various stimuli to observers, asking them to describe their conscious experience

**William James: USA, Functionalism**

- Carried out research in opposite viewpoint
- Should explain How & Why instead of uncover elemental units
- Functionalists argued that one must get out of the lab to study organisms in real life situations

**John Watson: Behaviorism (1913)**

- Prediction and control of behavior
- Did not agree with introspection, should only focus on observable, overt behaviour
- Study of learning now important
- Behaviorism now viewed in a negative light
- Led to development of rigorous research methods without relying on introspection

**School of Gestalt Psychology: (Early 1900)**

- Psychology phenomena could not be reduced to simple elements, had to be analyzed and studied in their entirety
- Argues that an observer did not construct a perceptual exp or conscious cog exp based on simple elementary sensory aspects
- Rather, individuals were able to experience or perceive experience or an object as a whole

**Sir Francis Galton**

- individual differences and human cognitive abilities
- Wondered if intellectual abilities was subject to natural selection -> inherited.
- Invented number of cognitive ability tests
- Study of mental imagery as a cognitive ability

### 1C: The Cognitive Revolution (Mid 20th Century)

**Precursors to this revolution**

- **human factors engineering** presented new problems that needed solutions
	- WWII w complicated equipment and highly trained operators created the concept of the **person-machine system**
	- The idea that the machinery must be designed to interact with the operator's physical and cognitive capacities & limitations
	- Beginning to recognize the limits of the human mind
- **developments in the field of linguistics**
	- Led by Noam Chomsky, began to see important of studying how people acquire, understand and produce language.
	- Early work showed that behaviorism didn't explain language
	- Skinner argued children learned language through imitation, but Chomsky argued that humans have an innate capacity to acquire language
- **developments in neuroscience and localization of function in the brain**
	- Work by Donald Hebb, suggested that functions were constructed by cell assemblies, connections among sets of cells in the brain
	- David Hubel and Tortsten Weisel demonstrated specific cells specialized to respond to certain stimuli, additionally, they demonstrated that early experience shaped brain development (kittens that only had horizontal lines failed to develop the ability to see vertical lines
- **The Computer Metaphor of the Mind**
	- development of computer and AI systems led to the comparison of people's cognitive activities to a computer

### 1D: Paradigms of Cognitive Psychology

4 major paradigms

**Information Processing Approach**

- human mind/computer analogy: cognition is thought of as information, system is our mind
- Information processing happens through low level detectors and registers (visual + auditory), through temporary memory stores and then into long-term/semi-permanent memory
- At every step, the information can be partially processed
- **Several Key Assumptions:**
    - 1) People cognitive abilities thought of as "systems". Cognition is built upon many interacting subskills and abilities.
    - 2) People can perform impressive cognitive feats by applying only a few mental operations to symbols (etters, numbers, sentences, visual images) **general purpose symbol manipulators**.

**Connectionism**

- Cognitive machinery that underlies all cognition is composed of highly interactive network of connections among simple processing units.
- These simple processing units are sometimes compared to neurons in the brain: referred to as **neural networks**
- None localist,there is no central place where all things are stored, thought to be distributed throughout the simple processing units. (Similar to a weighted graph)
- The weight of these connections are based on prior experience and prior learning
- When a unit reaches activation, it notifies its neighbours (similar stored thoughts) and once the activation is strong enough it comes to mind
- Connectionist model is extremely flexible

**Key differences and similarities**

- Information processing: pipeline, step by step model.
- Connectionism: processes occur in parallel
- Both assume that cognition will be best understood by uncovering the basic mechanics.
- Both assume mechanisms underlying cog procs are stable across situations and only revealed under rigorously controlled experimental conditions: research must be done in a lab.

**Evolutionary**

- Mind has had to respond and change in response to evolutionary pressure
- Cosmides & Tooby (UCal) believe that some of the most sig issues our ancestors faced were social issues: enforcement of social contracts & detection of cheaters
- Must be good at reasoning and decision making

**Ecological**

- cognition does not occur in a context free vacuum (all cognitive activities are shaped by culture, the context and the situation in which they occur.
- **context in which it happens shapes the cog proc**
- to understand cog, you must examine it in its natural context

## QUIZ 1

1. Gestalt asserts that psychologic phenomena cannot be reduced to simple elements but must be studied in their entirety
2. Behaviourism rejected references to unobservable mental states such as consciousness
3. Empiricism had notions that knowledge comes from experience, environment plays a powerful role in determining intellectual ability and learning takes places through mental association
4. A paradigm is an intellectual framework used to guide research and identify what is and is not important in a field of research

## Module 02:

### 2a: Introduction

### 2b: Structure of the Brain

**Main structures of the phylogenetic division:**

- Hindbrain
- midbrain
- forebrain

Only focused on the forebrain (where cognition happens).
The only parts support low level, non-cognitive functions, such as basic life support and the relay of information from the spinal cord to the rest of the brain.

**Forebrain**

** view the figures? **
Broken down into sub-sections

**Subcortical structures**

   - Thalamus (centre): main function: switching or relay station for sensory information around the brain
   - Hypothalamus (beside thalamus): regulate basic bio functions: hunger, thirst, temp, libido, basic emotions - Hippocampus: (right under temp lobes): learning & memory
   - Amygdala: emotion and aggression, modulates the str of memories in terms of emotional content

**Cortical Structures**

 - Cerebral cortex (outer most layer): several layers od densley packed neurons with white matter underneath. contains the sub-components
 - No direct connections between 2 lobes, however information can be communicated through corpus callosum and the anterior commisure
      - **Frontal lobe:**(front) Need to divide this into 3 seperate regions
	        - **Precentral Gyrus:**(next to parietal lobes), motor cortex for fine motor movement
	        - **Premotor Cortex:** (anterior to motor cortex), involved in planning such movements
	        - **Prefrontal Cortex:** (everything anterior to the premotor cortex), 'executive functioning': planning, making decisions, implementing strats, inhibiting inappropriate behaviours, using working memory to process information.
        - **Parietal lobe:** (top) spatial processing and attention, contains somatic sensory cortex involved in sensing information (pain, pressure, touch, temp)
        - **Occipital lobe:** (back) visual processing such as orientation, shape and colour, recognizing what objects are
        - **Temporal lobe:**(side) auditory processing , also support info encoding and retrieval from long-term memory (since directly above amyg + hippocampus)

---

## 2c: Localization of Function

**Franz Gall**

- believed in something called faculty psychology (human abilities were associated with specific regions of the brain)
- believed these abilities were autonomous and independent
- **Johan Spurzheim** (gall's student) went further; he thought the str was correlated to the size of the brain region that supported them. **phrenology**
- Ex: someone highly punctual would have a slightly larger region of the brain just above the nose, dumb idea
- Problem was the assumption that they were completely autonomous & indep. functions operate highly interactively

**Double Dissociations**

- patient1 dmg to area X
- patient1 impaired cognition A, but not B
- patient2 dmg to area Y,
- Y != X
- patient2 impaired cognition B but not A
- **brain dmg & behaviour are completely dissociated, show opposite mirror image patterns**
- Ex: Broca & Wernick's Aphasia,
	- Broca: left frontal lobe: deficit in speech production
	- Wernick: damage auditory association cortex, deficit in language comprehension
- This was applied to motor control, losing the very top/dorsal part of the primary motor cortex would affect control of feet, lower damage lost control of their mouth.

**Wilder Penfield**

- Canadian researcher/neurosurgeon, founder of Montreal Neurological Institute
- Developed the **Montreal Procedure** for localizing the source of epileptic seizures in patients.
- Probed brain tissue of patients under local anesthetic to look for scar tissue that caused epilepsy
- Created maps of sensory and motor cortices of the brain in more detail, these maps are still used today

---

## 2d: Brain Imaging Techniques

**Static Imaging: structure**

- Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) scan
	- highly focused converging beams of x-rays pass through the head from many different angles
	- different issue have different densities and deflect X-rays differently allowing visualization
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan
	- Creates a powerful magnetic field
	- electromagnetic signalsallow the visualization of the brain
	- typically preferred over CAT scans
		- 1) no exposure to radiation
		- 2) provide a more detailed image
		- 3) Several other powerful functions, can measure dynamic/function aspects of the brain with MRI, can't with CAT

**Dynamic Imaging: function**

Nuerons firing produce electrical activity, using metal electrodes on the scalp, we can measure this activity's time, source or location of activty to infer how the brain is responding to certain stimuli
The technique that is most commonly used to measure this electrical activity as a function of cognitive tasks is called Event-Related Potentials (ERP). Dynamic imaging is based on the byproduct of this electrical activity: metabolism/blood flow in the brain.

- Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
- functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) **most popular**
	- measures the inflow and outflow of oxygenated blood in the brain, referred to as Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent function (BOLD)
	- oxygenated & de-oxygenated blood have different magnetic properties, measure these properties
	- As neurons fire, blood flow increases as a function of neural activity
		- Initially, region to perform cognitive task take a dip in BOLD function, then slow influx of blood to that region peaks 10-15 seconds after.
		- Use BOLD function to find out which regions are related to or correlated with performance on that task
		- **Caveat:** every task we do is a combination of many underlying mechanisms: so how do we isolate the regions responsible?
- Donders: **Subtractive Logic**: In order to measure the time for a process to occur, you need to compare two reaction times or two tasks. one which is the same components as the other, plus the process of interest
	- Ex: want to measure time it takes to decide a colour, simple decision task. Participants see green or red light and their task is to hit the button when it is green but not red. If it takes X seconds, we still can't say it takes X to make a decision about colour. (There is decision time + motor/manual process). Simple task will now be: just simply hit a button when they see any colour of light. Best estimate would be Time of X - Time of Simple Task.

## 2e: Summary of the Brain: Structure and Function

- Phylogenetic Division: hindbrain, midbrain, forebrain
	- forebrain: cerebral cortex + four different lobes of the cerebral cortex
	- Frontal: planning, movement, executive function
	- Parietal: reception and integration of sensory information and spatial processing
	- Occipital: processing visual information
	- Temporal: auditory and taste/smell
- Determining localization of the brain = double associations
- Brain Imaging: CAT, MRI, PET, fMRI, ERP
- Donders: subtractive technique provides a means of isolating cognitive processes and brain regions whose activity varies in an experimental task compared to a control task

4. Wernicks area is associated with speech recognition
5. Relay structure in the forebrain is the thalamus
6. CAT scan is X-Rays

## 3a: Introduction to Perception

## 3b: Bottom-up Processes

Driven by the data, perceived and then concluded

**Template Matching**

- Grocery Store Example: bar code encoded, brings into the system, searches memory for the exact match, now know the name and price and can identify the item
- Human template matching: object registered as stimulus, would be compared to templates in memory until a match is found and the object be named
- Problems:
	-  if identification requires an exact match, the # of templates stored is huge
	- model does not explain how we can recognize a new object that we've never seen before
	- model does not explain surface variation in stimuli (sentences written differently all have same percept), recognize things that are upside down

**Feature Analysis**

- recognize objects by recognizing their component parts, features and the manner in which they are combined
- **Selfridge's Pandemonium model**
	- dumb demons: feature analyzers
	- they scream when they encounter the stimulus they're trained to see, louder the more confident it is
	- Image demon first encodes, brings stimulus into the model, examined by many feature demons
	- Finally, decision demon that listens chooses the cognitive demon screaming the loudest.
- System is much more flexible than template matching, allows for common features between objects
- **Hubel & Wiesel**: found evidence in cats and monkeys where cells fire selectively to certain features (like the demons)
- humans make mistakes identifying things when they have very many features in common, mix up b and d
- Problems:
	- What if we've never seen a feature before?
	- What is a feature and what isn't?

**Prototype Matching**

- attempts to correct problems from template-matching and feature analysis.
- Requires holistic input to be matched to stored representation
- It is a "best fit" model instead of exact (template matching)
- This accounts for flexibility in human perception

---

## 3c: Top-down Processes

Conceptually-driven processes rather than coming solely from the environment, come from the observers. They consist of our world knowledge, our theories, prior experiences and expectations.

Examples:

- a circle at breakfast would be perceived as a timbit but a golfball on a golf course
- perceiving sentences, they are interpreted based on known laws of a language
- making mistakes on a paper, familiarity with your own work makes you perceive what you expect to be there not what is there

**We need both bottom-up and top-down processing**

- If we perceived only top-down, would never be able to perceive new stimulus.
- use a solely-data driven process the first time, after the first time, future encounters will be influenced by prior experience

---

## 3d: Disruptions of Perception

**Case Study**

- An individual suffering from a stroke or other brain injury may be tested with note made of both preserved and damaged abilities, we draw connections between the perception and the brain area that contributes

**Visual Agnosia**

- The ability to identify an object by sight
- Individuals can "see" the object, they just can't identify the object
- **Apperceptive Agnosia:**
	- Can see and interpret contours and outlines
	- Difficult time maintaining basic representations in memory to match objects or distinguish amonst them
	- Ex: difficulty recognizing pictures where too many contours are missing or a strange perspective
- **Associative agnosia**
	- can match objects and copy drawings but slowly
	- can't name objects they've seen or copied
	- Cannot access meaning, or semantics from visual description alone
	- Ex: cup of coffee, would not be able to name it but would be able to drink from it if thirsty
- **Prosopagnosia**
	- only specific to faces, can't recognize faces
	- lack aware face recognition, cannot overtly name someone from looking at a photograph of the face
	- Galvanic skin response recorder will show different responses to loved ones verses stranges, perspiration, respiration change.
	- Shows response in galvanic skin test, can recognize faces, just not consciously
- **Capgras Syndrome:**
	- preserved explicit or overt face recognition, but impaired implicit or covert face recognition
	- can look at a picture and tell you who the picture looks like
	- does not provoke GSR patterns that distinguish unknown faces
	- claim people are imposters, looks like mom, talks like mom, but not mom!
	- denial because reasoning behind lack of GSR.

Explicit Recognition: can't name someone from looking from them
Implicit Regonition: GSR response

## 3d: Summary of Perception

Although perception is guided by the stimulus, it is affected by what the observer contributes as well.

## QUIZ 3

1. Bottom up: users take in small amount of information from the environment and combine it to form a percept
2. Ecological approach overlaps most with the evolutionary approach
3.  N/A
4. Naturalistic Observation is advantageous because it has high ecological validity
5. Prosopagnosia: unable to recognize faces
6. Familiarity that you get seeing someone you may have encountered before, demonstrates pattern recognition
7. Devlopment of human factors engeering, localization, chomsky produced the cognitive revolution
8. Mode, Quality, Intensity and Duration compromise the four building blocks, as the basis for any conscious thought or idea - Wundt
9. Selfridge's model can be described as a Feature Analysis Model of perception
10. Apperceptive agnosia leads to difficulty categorizing object although they can recognize the contours of the object
11. Prototype matching is a model of perception described as being less rigid as it enables feature-matching based on a holistic input and does not need to be an exact match
12. With the Cognitive Revolution, came the study of internal depictions of information, also known as Mental Representations

## 4a Introduction to Attention

William James:
“Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state which in French is called distraction and Zerstreutheit in German.” William James, from Principles of Psychology, pp. 381-382

Exploring **selective attention**: how we decide what to pay attention to, how some actions don't require any attention at all.

## 4b Selective Attention

**Donald Broadbent - Filter Theory**

- Referred to as an "Early Selection" model: it posits that attention selection operates very early in the stream of processing, before the observer knows what the information is, and that selection is based on physical characteristics like where the information is coming from.
- Selection occurs then, early, before any meaning information (semantics) are processed from the item.
- **Dichotic listening task:** (listening to 2 individual messages, 1 in each ear)
	- Observer asked to shadow one of the messages (repeat it) as they both play
	- Found: Observers were good at shadowing the message they were supposed to pay attention to, had no idea what the other message was saying
	- Broadbent argued: attention selection was selecting material from the appropriate channel, allowing it to be processed to the point where one could understand that information. Information in the other channel was not processed past physical characteristics (pitch, volume)
- Problems with this: **Cocktail Party Effect (Moray 1959)**
	- At a party, you'll notice somebody call your name while trying to focus intently on a single conversation. With broadbent's model, you would not hear your name at all.
	- Using dichotic listening, Moray showed people noticed their names when played in the unattended channel.

**Anne Treisman**

- Underscored Broadbent's model by showing that when shadowing, we pick up information from the unattended channel but only when it's important to us (name, or warning like fire),
- **Attenuation Theory or Leaky Filter Model**
	- Like Broadbent's early selection model. No processing of information from unattended channel. The only information that gets processed from the unattended channel is information that leaks through the filter: information that has special value to us

**Corteen and Wood**

- Paired Canadian City names with electric shocks until the mere mention of these names produced a fear response that could be measured in the observers' galvanic skin response (GSR)
	- GSR also measures respiration, perspiration that can be picked up on the skin
- Observers participated in dichotic listening task while playing the Canadian city names in unattended channel.
- Observers did not report hearing the city names but produced GSR when names were played, indicating they had process the unattended channel
- Corteen and Wood also embedded other cities in the unattended message. Cities that had never been paired with shock before. Observers still produced GSRs when new city names were presented despite having never heard them
- **Items were process to the level of semantics**, as only then can these other city names be processed as a Canadian city.
- **Results:** Provided a major challenge to early selection theory: it suggests that perhaps all information in the unattended channel is process to the level of meaning or semantics even if the observer is unaware

**Deutsch-Normal model**

- Corteen and Woods led to the development of a late selection model of attention
- All information is processed until the point at which we can access its meaning in long term memory. Selective attention then operates at this late stage to direct our awareness or guide our response to that information
- **Even if we aren't aware, we may process it and have it activated its representation in memory that can influence our behaviour**

## 4c Automaticity and Practice

In this section we view attention according to a resource metaphor: having fuel that is necessary to complete a task. Process becomes automatic as it requires fewer attentional resources to perform, typically through practice.

**John Ridley Stroop: The Stroop Effect**

- First publishes paper in 1935
- The idea that automatized processes interfere with behaviour
	- Ex: Reading non-matching words of different colours. ("Red" written in green)
	-   Hypothesized that reading is such an automatic process that one can't prevent it

**Controlled Processes**

- Controlled behaviours are said to be those that we undertake serially, one at a time that require attention.
- Said to be capacity limited, meaning if we attempt a second, at some point we'll not have enough resources to perform both
- Controlled processes are under conscious control
- Ex: Learning to ride a bike

**Automatic Processes**

-  Automatic processing occurs without our intention, we often are not aware of doing it
- It does not interfere with mental activities (although the result may as seen in Stroop task)
- Automatic processing can occur in parallel with other processes because they require little or no attention at all

## 4d Disorders

- Strokes lead to disorders in attention, over 50,000 each year in Canada, 75% are left with at least a minor impairment or disability, impairment in attention is commonly seen
- The most common is **visual neglect (hemispatial neglect or unilateral neglect)**

**Visual Neglect**

- Associated with lesions in the parietal area of the right hemisphere
- Patient neglects the contralateral hemi-space: the patient suffering from a RH parietal lesion will neglect the left visual hemi-space.
- In some cases, the patient will even neglect the contralateral (left side of their body), even sometimes denying the left arm or leg that belongs to them
- This is attentional, not sensory: not that they can't see, just can't attention, attention being held on the right side
- Ex: **Line bisection task**: presented with a horizontal line, and asked to draw a vertical line to bisect the horizontal line (cut it in half), a person suffering from neglect with bisect the line much farther to the right, indicating failure on the left part of the line.
- Researchers often present individuals with many lines spread across a page, patients suffering usually neglect all lines on the left side of the page
- Ex: Ask patients to copy simple drawings, most can still see and draw but typically miss all the information on the left, resulting in incomplete objects that don't make sense
- Affects other aspects in life such as eating and grooming.

**Bisiach andLuzzatti**

- Tested 2 individuals with visual neglect who grew up in very distinct, old, Italian villages.
- Important buildings (churches, town halls and libraries) were organized on the a square plaza centered around a fountain.
- B&L asked patients to imagine standing on one end and to describe the plaza.
- Patients described the right side but not the left side
- B&L asked patients to imagine standing on the other side now, again they could only describe the right side.
- **The other side existed in memory, just unable to attend to the visual memory**

## 4e Real World Applications

**David Strayer and William Johnston**

- Asked their particpants to perform a pursuit tracking test:
	- seated in front of a computer, they were asked to keep the cursor on the moving target
	- periodically while the cursor was moving, it would turn red, in which case participants were asked to press a button, or if it turns green, they were asked to ignore the color change (This was modeled after the need for a drivers brake response)
	-  First asked to perform this task alone, then in one of two dual task conditions (meaning there's a second task). The second task could be listening to a radio broadcast, or trying to maintain a telephone conversation
- Results: more errors (in the form of missed red lights), were made in the dual task condition but only when the dual task was maintaining a conversation. Listening to a radio broadcast did not affect the performance at all.
- Results: Even responding to the red change happened more slowly than participants merely listening to a radio broadcast
- Other research made it clear that difficulty is not dictated by use of ones hands, hands-free phones did not solve the attention problem
- **Interestingly:** speaking on cell phone is more dangerous than speaking to a passenger: they likely share joint attention with the driver and adjusts expectations of the conversation according

## 4f Summary of Attention

- Selection appears to be early, before meaning, or after meaning at times.
- May be in response to the environment, internal state and the number and type of other things we're trying to do
- Automatic performance can come from practice (riding a bike), this brings benefits but can also interfere (stroop effect)
- Visual neglect: impaired attention
- Impact of cell phone use on driving

## QUIZ 4

- MRI over cat: spatial res, no radiation, better information about neuroanatomy
- Emotional content of memory: amgydala
- Evidence for automatic reading processes come from the Stroop effect
- Hemispatial Neglect is considered a Attentional Disorder
- A neuroimaging method that enables us to measure the time course of the brain’s response to a particular event: ERP
- The hippocampus is responsible for: Long-term memories
- Broadbent argues that physical characteristics of a message, such as its location are processed while other information is blocked out unless attended to
-  The midbrain transmitting information between the brain and the body
- Tasks that involve dichotic listening have shown that while people shadow one message presented in the attended ear, they are able to report on the pitch and tone from different message in the unattended ear
- In a classic study Moray found that participants were able to recognize their name in the unattended ear
- The left frontal lobe is responsible for language/speech production
- Automatic processes are unaffected by massive amounts of practice and operate in parallel

## 5a Introduction to Memory Structures

**Roadmap**

- Memory stores
	- Sensory Memory
	- Short Term & Working Memory
	- Long term (Episodic & Semantic Memory)
- Neurological studies of memory
	- Clive Wearing, encephalits caused profound memory defecits
	- Ex: He can still play piano, conduct a choir, he can still sing but can't remember what happened 5 minutes ago, can't go outside alone as he'd become lost

## 5b Sensory Memory

Preliminary Terms:

- **Encoding:** how information is acquired, translated into a form that other cog processes can use
- **Retrieval  / Decoding:** calling to the mind to get previously stored information
- **Forgetting:** when we cannot retrieve previously stored information, different between memory structures

**Modal Model of Memory - Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968)**

-  Several Different modules where information can be encoded, stored and retrieved from.
- Flow:
	- Hearing of Viewing information: Imprinted briefly in sensory memory system
	- There may be rehearsal to remember, doing so happens within short-term memory
	- If you try to rehearse it over and over and try to encode it in a more meaningful way, that information will be stored in long term memory, which it will be stored there indefinitely
- This model has stood the test of time and is general accepted

**Sensory Memory**

- Refers to the initial brief storage of sensory information
- Ex: Hear a telephone number, or see it, the brief moment where it's imprinted on your mind
- Some argue it's just another form of perception
- Many believe that there are different types of sensory memories that are seperate:
	- Visual (Iconic)
	- Auditory (Echonic)
	- Olfactory
	- Tactile

**Iconic Memory**

- Ex: When you view a lightening strike, it feels like it lasts a fair amount of time, it seems to linger in our perception for a second or so however in reality it lasted a couple hundred milliseconds
- Your sensory memory, iconic memory, is storing an imprint of that image occuring in front of you
- Q: How much information can be stored?
- Q: How long can it persist?

**Sperling (1960)**

- Presented participants with brief display of a 3x4 matrix of letters, for about 50 ms (just barely see a flash)
- Asked participants how many letters they could actually see. He found that they could report, on average, about four or five of the letters out of 12
- Participants had seen all of the stimuli quite clearly, but when they started reporting them they soon forgot the rest,
- It would take a few seconds for them to report the letters and then they had forgotten what the whole display was, Sperling came up with a way to see if there was more information stored than what could be reported in a brief amount of time
- **Partial Report Condition**
	- previous condition is called the **whole report**, to report all of the stimuli they had seen, now were given a cue to report only a single row based on the pitch of a note (low, med, high)
	- Participants could reliably report 3 or 4 letters in that row
	- Regardless of the tone sounded, experiment indicated they held roughly 9 letters in sensory memory
- **In terms of letters, sensory information could hold between 9-12**

**Q: How long does it last in sensory information?**

- Similarly with the amount of information stored, Sperling now included a delay between when the stimulus was presented and the time at which participants could report the information
- Results: After about one second, the partial delay advantage completely disappeared, they could only report 5 or 6 letters, After a second delay, participants were no better than the full report technique
- **Visual Sensory Memory (Iconic), only lasts around one second**
- If not allowed to rehearse the information, it will fade away in a very brief amount of time

**Conclusions**

- Information seems to require attention to move into long-term memory
- Needs active rehearsal to be moved to long term, sensory does not require this
- Sensory memory guarantees a minimum amount of time information is available for processing, can process it or let it fade away, cache of the brain

## 5c Short-Term Memory

**Serial Position effect: ** Better at remembering things at the beginning or end of the series

**Recency effect:** better at remembering things that happened most recently

**Task of remembering a long list**

- see the serial position effect and recency effect, participants good at remembering beginning and end of list
- People typically try to off-load the end of the list from their short-term memory first, then look into long-term memory to get the information presented at the beginning of the list
- First few words typically rehearsed, encoded into long term memory

**Geroge Millers article 1956**

“My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer. For seven years this number has followed me around, intruding into my most private data, and has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals. This number assumes a variety if disguises, being somewhat a little smaller than usual, but never changing as much as to be unrecognizable. The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random accident, there is, to quote a famous senator, "a design behind it,” some pattern governing its appearances. Either there really is something unusual about the number, or else, I’m suffering from delusions of persecution.”
**Referring the the "magic number seven", the maximum number of information that can correctly recalled from short-term memory** (plus or minus 2 bits of information)

This magic number 7, can be increased dramtically with **Chunking**, grouping up several items together into meaningful groups. You take what you know in long-term memory to organize and store information in your short-term memory

**Information Forgotten in Short-Term memory**

- Two main theoretical approaches to forgetting information
- **Trace Decay**:
	- The automatic fading of the memory trace
- **Interference**:
	- The disruption of the memory trace by other traces, where the degree of interference depends upon the similarity of the two memory traces
	- Focus mostly on interference theory, the most predominate view

**Interference**

- **Proactive interference**
	- Where old information makes it too difficult for you to acquire or recall new information
	- Ex: Trying to give people your new phone number, but your old one keeps coming to mind, can't remember the new one
- **Retroactive interference**
	- where new information makes it difficult for you to recall old information
	- Ex: When you start recalling your new phone number, can't remember your old one
- **Short-term memory seems to have both trace decay and interference**

**Brown-Peterson paradigm**

- Participants are presented with three-consonant trigrams (ex: HLM) and are given a number, such as 492, asked to count backward out loud by 3's for a fixed rate of time
- Counting is to prevent participants from rehearsing the trigram, and preventing them from getting it into long-term memory
- Task shows that information decays from short-term memory fairly quickly, after only 3 seconds, roughly 80% of participants can recall the trigram, however, counting for 18 seconds this drops to 7%, that is, after 18 seconds, short-term memory is gone
- After this work, a lot of researchers challenged the idea that forgetting short-term memory was just due to trace decay, argued that you could account for the Brown-Peterson paradigm with interference, that the task was not efficient enough to tap into interference.

**Wickens, Born and Allen**

- Designed a modified Brown-Peterson paradigm that switched categories after a few trials, the idea being that if you switch categories you can find something called release from proactive interference.
- Had participants perform the BP task over and over, when they repeated sometimes would use a different category type.
- Control group only used 1 type, but experimental group switched after several trials
- Ex: Remember number trigram or letter trigram
- Results: Dropoff from 70% down to 10% for letters and 40% for numbers, then it levels off. When the category switched, the performance went right back up to the ceiling again. **The last trial did not interefere with their ability to learn a new trigram**

## 5d Long Term Memory

**Capacity of long-term memory**

- Potentially infinite, but can't all be retrieved at any give time, we've lost easy access to some of it
- long-term memory likely coded in terms of semantics (what it is, meaning), vs short-term which is thought to be based on acoustic or visual properties (superficial, low-level features)
- Q: So how long does it last???

**Bahrick (1984)**

- Studied retention of Spanish language information from 733 adults who were taking a high-school or university course in Spanish
- Looked at retention of this information for up to fifty years
- Results: Significant drop from 100% to 40% after the first 2 years, 2 months and then it levels off and remains flat, not much loss after 2 years
- Coined the term "permastore" for long-term memory, because large portions remained accessible for over 50 years despite not being used or rehearsed
- **Forgetting seems to happen relatively rapidly, then tapers off**

**Forgetting in long-term memory**

- Vast majority of research focused on interference theory
- Use of **Retrieval Cues**:  a point to recover a target memory, like putting a sticky note on a monitor, a reminder to do something
- The more memorable retrieval cues, the easier to retrieve
- having retrieval cues that are associated with multiple memories means they are less memorable because of interference
- Ex: Trying to find parking but you often come to the same parking lot, it will activate multiple memories.
- **In order to correctly recall information, you need a very powerful and uniquely associated retrieval cue**

**Q: What makes a good retrieval cue?**

- **Recollection of an event occurs IFF properties of the event are sufficiently similar to the retrieval information**
- That is, retrieving information is reliving that original encoding experience and bringing yourself to that context
- Information learning in a particular context is better recalled if recall takes place in that same context

**Gaudin and Baddeley, context-dependent memory**

- Asked a bunch of professional scuba divers to learn lists of word either on land, on the shore or underwater.
- After they encoded this information, they gave them a memory test on land or underwater
- Study showed perfect double dissociation, words studied on land recalled much better on land, same with underwater.
- **Recall happened best when the encoding conditions matched the retrieval conditions**
- Exposing to same encoding environment means retrieval cues surrounding the original encoding is available to be used.

## 5e Working Memory


- Working memory model, not as simple as originally proposed short-term model
- Since the time of Atkinson and Shiffrin, we've discovered that short-term memory's equated with consciousness, and is thought to be the place where various cog control processes happen, the place that governs the flow of information, into and out of consciousness
- Working memory system is thought to consist of a limited capacity workspace that can be divided between storage and control processing

**Baddeley and Hitch (1974)**

- Asked participants to perform two different tasks at the same time
	- First task: Concurrent digit load: holding either 0,2,4,6, or 8 digits (which should have "tied up" all memory)
	- Second task: Syntactic verification task (first principles math garbage, "A follows B = BA"
- Results:
	- Participants error rate did not increase as the digit load increased, they took more time but the errors did not increase meaning they were capable of performing the task
	- If we are only able to hold 7 +-2 items then the participants would not be able to perform the additional task

**Allan Baddeley**

- Conceived working memory as consisting of three components
	- Central Executive: thought of as an attention system rather than memory, per se, it directs information to and from the two sub-systems.
	- Phonological Loop: thought to carry out sub-vocal rehearsal and maintain verbal information
	- Visual-Spatial Sketchpad: thought to retain visual information through visualization
	- It is thought that the 2 subsystems can operate independently of each other (Supports earlier experiments)

## 5f The Semantic/Episodic Distinction

- A lot of evidence for episodic and semantic memory comes from neurological studies of memory
- Researches found that long-term memory works in similar ways, we can store multiple different types of information in long-term memory
- A lot of work was pioneered by Endel Tulving ~1970, found that it contained two distinctive, yet interactive systems: episodic and semantic memory

**Episodic Memory**

- Contains information about one's personal experience
- Memories here have a specific date and time associated with them or are temporally organized
- Ex: Thinking about your last birthday
- Also known as autobiographical memory

**Semanitc Memory**

- General knowledge base, information about language and the world
- Organized around meaning- ex: facts and concepts, rather than temporally organized
- Ex: knowing that Paris is the capital of France does not require you to go back and relive the experience of learning that fact, it simply comes to mind


## 5g Neurological Studies of Memory

- Study patients who have suffered damage to the hippocampal system: hippocampus, amygdala and related nesial structures around those areas, due to head injury, stroke, brain tumour or disease
- Studies show patients may show very selective impairments of memory

**Dan Schacter - Case Study: Jean**

- Motorcycle accident at the age of 30
- Damage to frontal and temporal lobes, including hippocampus
- Jean preserved intellectual functioning; he had average intelligence, average memory span, language and normal vocabulary - **All things under semantic memory**
- Seems to have lost his episodic memory, doesn't remember his brother's death, how he broke his arm etc.
- Information that would have timestamps, or would require him to go back and re-live the original encoding experience to recall it.

**Dan Schacter - Case Study: Woman's Encephalitis**

- Encephalitis, caused woman to suffer damage to the frontal temporal lobes of her brain, and she lost semantic memory
- She forgot meanings of common words and basic attributes of objects
- Had completely intact episodic memory, remembered her wedding, fathers death etc.

**Anterograde Amnesia**

- Inability to form new memories after the event
- Event may be traumatic brain injury, disease due to encephalitis, stroke, etc
- Typically affects episodic memory, but not semantic memory
- Ex: Clive Wearing
- Most patients with Anterograde have Retrograde Amnesia as well

**Retrograde Amnesia**

- Loss of memory for past events prior to the injury
- Would be able to learn and encode new events post-injury
- Doesn't affect overlearned skills, such as social skills or language
- Most patients experience retrograde without anterograde amnesia

## 5h Summary

- Atkinson and Shiffrins modal model of memory
	- seperate short-term & long-term systems
- sensory memory
	- module specific, brief duration storage, if attended to, may pass to short term
- Short term, related to our conscious experience
- George Miller's work suggested you could hold 7 +- 2 items in short term memory and remain for around 20 seconds unless deeper rehearsal took place
- Allen Baddeley showed it wasn't that simple, with the double task
	- Phonological loop + visual-spatial sketchpad
- Long term: easier to recall if context is the same when recalling
- Episodic memory: events that have timestamps, you can relive these moments
- Semantic memory: facts, general knowledge, concepts
- 2 Amnesia

---

## Quiz 5

- The loss of the ability to recall old memories is called retrograde amnesia
- Top down factor that guides perception: context & env
- Agnosia associated with ability to draw but unable to name things they've drawn: associative agnosia
- Attention not required for information to enter iconic memory
- Proximal image on the retina is also known as sensation
- Just listened to 20 words, most likely to remember first and last words
- Prosopagnosics display difficulty with facial recognition
- Iconic Memory holds visual information in a relatively unprocessed form and can hold more information that can be reported
- Selfridges' model describes demons as feature-detectors
- Information is held in short-term memory for 20-30 seconds
- Visual disruption that impairs the ability to interpret visual information and identify objects is referred to as visual agnosia
- Short term memory item capacity is estimated to be 5-9 items

---

## 6a Introduction

**Roadmap**

- Memory in terms of processes for processing memory
- One's ability to retrieve information depends largely on how well we stored that information in memory, not the particular place
- Memory is not a carbon copy of what was seen or processed, quite malleable and changes over time
- More forgetting due to brain trauma or disease
- Episodic + Semanitc memory
- Implicit and Explicit memory

## 6b Levels of Processing

**Gus Craik and Bob Lockhart (UofT)**

- Theory identifies 2 types of rehearsal that can be done to store information in memory
	- Maintenance rehearsal
		- What one does to simply memorize something
		- ex: Repeat a phone number to memorize it
		- Maintains or holds information until you need to use it, without transforming it into any other type of code
		- Does not promote good memory
	- Elaborative rehearsal
		- Promotes good memory
		- elaborate on the meaning of a concept
		- transform information into a deeper code, thereby promoting better retrieval
- Physical appearance (PA) tasks and rhyming (R) tasks are considered shallow, whereas meaning-based task (M) is considered deep.
- Craik and Lockhartwould predict that your memory would be better for the M items than for the PA and R items

**Gus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975)**

- Published an experiment for the above prediction
- Memory was better for M based tasks than for case and rhyme tasks

## 6c The Reconstructive Nature of Memory

**Bartlett (1930)**

- studied memory for more than just words, introduced the concept of a memory schema
- Participants asked to read the story "The War of the Ghosts" and their memory for the story was tested a short while after and several weeks later to study real-life memories
- **Results:**
	- Found that memory was quite malleable, individuals' memories changed
	- Over time, the memories for the story became more distorted, these distortions were consistent with items in their own cultures
	- Bartlett states that a schema is a framework for organizing memory and our own schemas are consistent with our prior life experience

**Flashbulb Memories**

- Memories that are crystal clear, vivid memories of an important event
- Ex: When they heard about 9/11
- Debate whether they are really such special and accurate memories but generally thought that they're different than mundane quotidian events. Possibly higher emotional content

**Elizabeth Loftus & Eyewitness Memory**

- In one of her earliest studies, she showed participants a film clip of a car crash
- Afterwords asked participants how fast the cars were going when they #{something} each other, with the blank filled by words "smashed, collided, bumped, hit and contacted" for separate groups.
- Speed estimates changed as a function of the word inserted into the blank
- A week later, participants were asked if they had remembered seeing the broken glass, there was no broken glass yet some participants remembered seeing it
- Those who received the stronger verb were more likely to misremember broken glass than those who received the weaker verbs
- **Clearly, memory is falliable**

**Deese (1920), Roediger and McDrermott (more recent)**

- Participants shown a short list of words, read through the list and after the last word disappears, write down all the words that you read, in the order you read them.
- Interest: whether your list of memories included a word that was closely related but was not included.
- 40% of participants recalled the word that was not presented but was related. They were nearly as confident in false memories as true ones
- Cabeza and colleagues, using brain imaging techniques showed that despite belief in false memory, the brain regions activated by false memories was actually different than the area for real memories

## 6d Amnesia

- Refer the last chapter for most of the material
- Korsakoff's syndrome: brain damage resulting from a lack of B vitamins generally due to the long-term abuse of alcohol
- Less severe amnesia caused by a car accident or fall


## 6e Semantic Memory

- Refer to last chapter for most of the material

**Collins and Quillians: Hierarchical semantic network**

- Concepts are organized into hierachies
- Ex: A bird is an animal, stored under animals
- **Cognitive Economy:**
	- When a concept shares all the characteristics of the concept it is stored under, unless a specific exception is made
	- ex: A bird, is an animal because it has skin, moves, eats and breathes
	- Essentially inheriting attributes from parent classes
	- Exceptions are like ostriches that can't fly but is a bird
- According to this model, when a concept is activated, all of its characteristics are activated and activation spreads between the links to related concepts
- This is known as **spreading activation**, hypothesized to allow us to activated associated concepts in memory
- Ex: If you think of doctor, also think of nurse


## 6f Implicit vs Explicit Memory

**Explicit Memory**

- Explicit tests of memory: you know you are being tested on your memory
- Ex: taking an exam
- Explicit memories are generally linked to particular periods of time

**Implicit Memory**

- Implicit Memory: memory tests that you are not aware of taking
- While individuals such as HM and Clive Wearing have greatly impaired explicit memory for new information, they show signs of implicit memory.
- That is, there is a small amount of learning that they may not be able to tie to an event but if tested, would be evident

**Warrington and Weiskrantz**

- Examining memory in amnesics and healthy controls
- Amnesics showed impairment relative to controls on explicit memory tests such as free recall and recognition, but their performance on two implicit tests: tword fragment identification and word stem completion, was not affected.
- Even amnesics would likely not consciously recall having studied the items or even the study session at all, but their behaviour shows evidence of having studied them before, they show implicit or even unconscious memory

## 6g Summary

- Memory as a process, instead of a place
- Remember better when thoughts are more complete with deeper processing
- Memory gets distorted, misremembering things (Loftus)
- Flashbulb memories are crystal clear
- People form memories for t hings that never happened

---

## Quiz 6

- Currently, this test is probing your explicit memory
- Remembering where you were when you heard about the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre is an example of what kind of memory? episodic
- The loss of the ability to form new memories is called anterograde amnesia.
- The notion that a concept shares all of the characteristics of the category it is stored under, unless a specific exception is made, reflects: Cognitive economy
- Filter theory hypothesizes a bottleneck. Late-selection theory hypothesizes a bottleneck at a later stage of processing..
- The research of Strayer and Johnson show that dual-task shows that talking on a cell phone Slows reaction time significantly more than listening to radio.
- You have been spending a lot of time with your friend Fred, who talks often about different birds, as he is a bird expert of sorts. When you were out for a walk on the weekend, you pointed out a red cardinal and a sparrow to your friend Ruby and were surprised that you knew the names of the birds. This type of accidental learning is called Incidental learning
- According to the results of research by Elizabeth Loftus, people tend to misremember the true nature or details of an event when they are guided by strong verbs, such as ‘smashed’
- The primacy effect is thought to result from participants’ use of long term memory.
- Retrograde amnesia is characterized by memory loss for past episodic or autobiographical events, but timespan varies greatly
- Controlled processing requires Attention and Concious Awareness
- The Deutsch-Norman Model suggests that selection occurs after all information has been processed right up the the level where we can access its meaning.
- The study by Moray reveals the cocktail party phenomenon, which suggests that: attention is a ‘leaky filter’, allowing some information to be granted access to consciousness, even when we are focusing on something else
- The cocktail party effect is thought to occur because words like your name have a permanently lowered threshold for recognition according to which theory? Treisman’s attenuation theory
- Which of the following is a component of Baddeley’s working memory model: (all: phological loop, visualspatial sketchpad, central executive)
- Which of the following is not true of iconic memory: it lasts about 20 seconds
- Research on Levels of Processing Theory shows that memory performance tends to be better when processing is meaning-based
- When previously learned material disrupts the learning of new material, this is called proactive interference

## 7a Introduction to Concepts and Categorization

**Definitions:**

- Concept: a mental representation of an object event or pattern. Everyone's concepts going to be different as they're based on individual experiences
-  Categorization: process by which we place things into groups
- Category: class or group of similar objects

**Smith and Medin (1981)**

“Without concepts, mental life would be chaotic. If we perceived each entity as unique, we’d be overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of what we experience, and unable to remember more than a minute fraction of what we encounter. And if each individual entity needed a distinct name, our language would be staggeringly complex, and communication virtually impossible.”

- Having categorization reduces the complexity of the environment.
- Requires less learning and memorization
- guides us to appropriate actions

## 7b Theoretical Descriptions of the Nature of Concepts

**Classical View**

- Category membership is determined by defining properties: properties that are deemed necessary and sufficient.
- Ex: A triange is three-sided and planar
- A feature is individually necessary if each member of the group must have that feature
- A set of features is collectively sufficient if each feature in the set is automatically an instance of the concept
- **Assumptions:**
	- Concepts are not thought to be representations of specific examples, just a list of properties
	- Membership is clear-cut: all or none, black or white
- **Problems:**
	- Some categories don't have any real defining features
	- Difficult to come up with defining features, dogs have 4 legs, what about one that's lost his 4th leg. Or a furless cat.
	- Found that people judge different members of a category as varying in goodness
	- Ex: Robin is a bird, not so good for penguins or chickens

**Prototype View (Rosch and Colleagues)**

- Idealized representation of a class of objects (Basically classical but flexible)
- Features are typical, rather than necessary or sufficient, averaged by members of the category
- Takes into account individual experiences and unique experiences
- Members of a class can differ
- Family resemblance depends on shared features, the more strongly it shares features with other members, the stronger the resemblance = more typical
- Each member has a number of features, sharing different features with different members, the features shared by more members are more typical
- **Problems**
	- Unconstrained, where do you draw the line?
	- Typicality of a certain instance depends on context, typicality is not fixed, a typical bird in the city could be a robin while on a farm it's a chicken


**Exemplar View**

- Asserts that concepts include actual representations of real instances that we've experienced
- When you categorize an object, you compare to your previously stored instances or **examplars**
- Assumes there are no dfining features
- **Problems**
	-  Hard to categorize when exemplars are similar to exemplars from other categories Ex: Tomatoes
	- Hard to create categories when it's willy nilly (like prototype)
	- Need to store a lot of exemplars
- Typical Instances are thought to be stored than less typical ones or to be more similar to stored examples
- This is why people are faster to process information about typical examples

**Allan and Brooks (1991)**

- Experiment to show that physical similarity to previously stored exemplars influences categorization despite participants having a simple and sufficient rule to follow
- Participants pretty much ignored the rule, just stick to using previously stored examples
- Use previously stored exemplars without being consciously aware of it

**Schemata View**

- Concepts are a form of schemata - frameworks of knowledge that have roles, slots, variables
- Ex: Schema for a car accident with things like broken glass, police.
- **Problem**
	- Very ill-defined, hard to empirically test it

**Knowledge-based View**

- Use knowledge of how concept is organized to justify the classification and explain why instances happen to go together in the same category
- Category only becomes coherent and meaningful when you know the purpose
- Highlights flexibility of categorization because it depends on individual experience/knowledge
- Addresses the limitations of the prootype + exemplar view

## 7c Forming new concepts and classifying new instances

**Bruner and Austin 1956**

- studied the ways people attain concepts using card depicting diff geo figures
- cards vary on 3 dimens:
	- circle, quare or cross
	- black, white or striped
	- one, two or three borders
- particips told the experimenter had in mind a concept such as black circles or all cards containing two borders and striped figures
- particips shown one card at a time that illustrated that instance: **a pos instance**
- asked to test each card to see if they comformed to the rule (to determine what the rule was)
- **Results**
	- 3 different types of strategies
	- **Simultaneous scanning**:
		- Test mult hypotheses at the same time (ex white and circles)
		- places heavy demand on working memory
	- **Successive Scanning**:
		- tests one hypothesis at a time until reasonably confident that they figured out one rule
		- time consuming, inefficient, low demands on working memory
	- **Conservative focussing**: focuses on card attributes, chooses cards that very only in one respect from the positive instance focus card
		- if the chosen attribute has changed and is still a member of the group then know it can be eliminated
		- low on working memory, doesn't guarantee a solution, run the risk of going in circles
	- More effective strategies typically use more working memory


**Using functional brain imaging**

- participants asked to respond to a series of what were thought to be abstract paintings as either done by painter Smith or Jones
- Judged a series of exemplars, each formed by changing the colour of each square with 7% probability, exemplars were extremely close to the original but not each other
- Woth practice participants would learn to distinguish between the 2 categories and able to respond appropriately
- **Results from brain images**:
	- Break it down to right/left hemisphere -> early/late learning
	- Early, only activity in the right hemisphere (prefrontal and parietal), stimuli moves through visual patterns
	- When we apply the rule, some sort of verbal mediation, part of the left hemisphere
	- As learning progresses, left hemi gets recruited more, specifically the left parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

**Explicit & Implicit**

- Depends on the task, simple -> explicit strategy to be employed
- Tasks that are complex deploy an implicit strategy
- Explicit = study games
- Implicit = Grammar

**The Seger Experiment**


## 7d Summary

- 5 views on categorizing concepts; first 3 are summarizing, 2 are "explanation-based"
- bla bla bla

## 8a Intro to Visual Imagery and Spatial Recognition

## 8b Visual Imagery and Memory

- Use mnemonics to improve memory

**Method of Loci**

- needs a series of well-known locations to remember everything
- Imagine a detailed trip through the location that you know, associate one item each location through your journey
- Recall your list by retracing your steps in this journey
- Supplemented with imaginite and interactive details

**Pegword method**

- First learn a list of ordered paired cues, ex: One-bun, two-shoe, three-tree
- Each item needs to be associated with an image in the paired cues
- Ex: You have a dentist appointment, form the bundle, one is a bun, biting into a bun and hurting your tooth
- Three is tree, need to pay the bills

Both these have an overhead cost of first having vivid locations or cued pairs.

**Q: Why do visual based mnemonics work?**
A: **Alan Pavio - University of Western Ontario** hypothesized that it was
because they allow information to be stored and encoded in two different ways

**Dual Code hypothesis**

- able to store words using verbal codes, as well as their image-based codes
- in contrast, words of abstract concepts don't have a strongly associated image
- Pavio states having a dual code improves memory over a single code
- Not all theorists agree with Pavio, some stated that memory for concrete items is superior to that for abstract items, not because of visual based memory but because we can generate more detailed verbal descriptions
- Analog vs Propositional debate; Pavios theory is analog

## 8c Manipulating Visual Images

**Sheperd and Metzler**


- published a series of experiements that give credence to the hypothesis that people can form mental images and manipulate them in space
- presented participants slides with 2 complex shapes, one typically the rotation of the other, asked particips to decide if it was just a rotation of the other.
- pairs of shapes varied in either picture-plane, depth or degrees of orientation
- **Results**
	- Observer reponse time acted as a function of the number of degrees of roatation
	- Same as if they were real objects, supports the idea of the mental rotation


** Stephen Kosslyn**

- extended sheperd and metzlers research with a series of image scanning experiments
- Ex: Asked to put finger on Montreal, asked a question about Winnipeg or Vancouver, would the response time be a function of the distance?
- Participants given maps in the study
- Asked to study map until they had it commited to memory
- Map was taken away and asked to form a mental image of the map
Then they were given a starting point, from tat point they were then asked a question about a place that was relatively near the start or a place relatively far
- **Results**
	- Consistent with Shepard and Metzler, it took longer for observers to answer questions about places further away from their starting points than it did for closer starting points

Both of these provide strong support for the analog view of imagery - mental images are useful codes, challenge propositional view - we only store abstract linguistic codes in memory
Reponse time differential makes no sense if we only store verbal descriptors


## 8d Imagery Debate

**Finke 1989**

- outlined important qualities in visual images
- Implicit encoding, without overtly encoding that information and retrieve it, Lee Brook, mcMaster
- Perceptual equivalence, imagery and manipulating those images, activate similar brain and mental systems as the physical object
- Spacial equivalence: spatial relations in images correspond to spatial relations in actual space (map scanning results)
- Transformational equivalence: (Shepard and Metzler), our performance in mental rotation is similar to performance in actually rotating objects
- Structural equivalence: images should be organized like physical objects
 (Kossyln), took people far longer to form complex images than simpler ones

**Debate**

- Not everyone agrees images are useful rep in visual memory, that images are true memory representations
- Argue that images are byproducts of abstract verbal and propositional codes, we form them as we activate these abstract verbal code, we do not process them or operate them as we would operate on a phsyical object
- Zenon Pylyshyn (Western) argued that many results of analog can be explained by concept of demand characteristics by the fact that we have a lot of implicit knowledge about the world, people know that it should take longer to move between points that are further apart and they behave accordingly
- Argues that you can never have an image in your head of something you've never seen: by-products of verbal descriptions
- New technology, pushes towards analog view
- Woman with right occipital lobe removed, found that her view for images was decreased along with her regular vision.
- Devreese 1991 discovered people who lost the ability to see colour due to brain damage are unable to create colours through imagery

## 9b Structures of Language

Semantics, Synthax, Pragmatics

Phonemes are smallest unit of sound,
Morphemes are smallest unit of meaning,

## 9c Language Comprehension and Production

Ability to understand language is complex due to several factors:

- Speech is continuous
- Individual phoneme can sound different based on the other phonemes around it

**Theory 1**

- We process speech in a categorical manner
- We are hard wired to efficiently force sounds into discrete categories
- Distinctions in sound that we hear as children can no longer be made by us once we have learned English, we perceive sounds in categories that fit the sound of our language

Q: What about our ability to produce it?

- Study speed production in errors
- We might switch phonemes for another ex "got a lot of pons and pats to wash"
- Even in our error, they appear sensitive to the rules of the language

## 9d Neuropsychological view and Evidence

**Broca's Aphasia**

- expressive aphasia
- left frontal lobe
- halting agrammatic speech,
- can express semantics but syntactically incorrect
- hard to produce language

**Wernicke's Aphasia**

- able to produce language
- hard to process and understand language

**Agnosia**

- anomia. difficulty naming objects
- alexia, visual language impairments (dyslexia)
- agraphia, inability to write
- alexia, without agraphia, can write but not read what they wrote

That is, for the most part, language in right handed individuals resides most strongly in the left hemisphere of the brain

**Generate and Test Technique**

- generate a number of potential solutions and test to see if they fit
- Simple solution, useful if there's a limited number of possibilities
- Problems:
	- Limited cognitive capacity that we have
	- the number of alternatives can easily surpass our capacity
- Ex: List of food that start with c

**Means-Ends analysis**

- Start from initial state, have a goal state, flesh out intermediate steps
- Ex: Tower of Hanoi
- Generate end goal, generate sub-goals that lead to the end goal

**Working Backwards**

- Think about end goal, find sub-goal from the end goal
- Ex: I want an A on the next test, subgoal: need to understand the material better, to do that need more efficient study strategies

**Reasoning by analogy**

- Map the problem to another problem to find the solution
- **Dick and Holyoak (1980)**
	- Found only 30% of individuals not told about the analogy noticed the analogy, even when they were given a hint that it could be used to solve the problem
	- 75% of individuals were able to extract the analogy between two different domains.
- Can be a powerful tool
- Ex: Circulatory system -> water pump, Hydrogen atom -> solar system

## 10c Blocks to Problem Solving

**Mental Set**

The tendency to adopt a certain framework or strategy to solve a problem. More generally, to see things in a certain way. It causes people to make bad assumptions.

**Functional Fixedness**

Cognitive bias that stops a person from using an object other than the way it's traditionally used

**Lack of knowledge or expertise**

Found that experts evaluate problems differently in the same context.
Expert chess players better at evaluating chess boards than novices, able to extract more information. But when the configuration was random, they had the same performance.

Experts see and represent the problem in a deeper more principles level than novices who represent the problem superficially. But this has to be domain specific.

## 10d Reasoning

**Deductive Reasoning**

- General to specific
- All students like pizza, Kerri is a student, so kerri likes pizza
	- **Conditional Reasoning**
		- Wason Selection Task: you are a clerk that has to make sure documents are marked properly, if it has A on one side, has 4 on the other, which ones do you have to turn over to verify this rule.
		- **Content Effect**: the content of the problem can facilitate the logical reasoning process. While participants failed the wason task, they could do it if it was about ages and what drink they were drinking.
			- Cause by Memory Cueing: certain contents of the problem cue experiences that are relevant to the rule. Problem is facilitated by personal experience
- **Categorical Reasoning (Syllogisms)**
	- People are presented with premises that deal with classes of entities, quantifiers provide information about how many members of a class are under consideration.
	- Ex: All red books are astro books, all astro books are large, therefore all red books are large.
	- People are affected by the **Believablility effect**, people are much more likely to accept a conclusion if it's believable

**Inductive Reasoning**

- Reasoning about conclusions that are likely but not guaranteed to be true
- Look at the Wason 2-4-6 task, given the 2-4-6 triplet and told that the triplet conforms to a particular rule. You have to give them triplets and the experimenter will tell you if it conforms to the rule.
- Most people guess numbers that increase by 2
- Rule is just that they're larger than the other
- Participants look to validate their own rule instead of disprove the rule.
- **Confirmation bias**

**Two Approaches to the study of Reasoning**

- **Rule-based approaches**
	- Argues people rely on special-purpose mental rules which we have implicit acces to, we can't consciously think about them, to draw conclusions
	- Can be context and domain-specific
- **Mental models**
	- Deny that reasoning consists of special rules
	- Argues that reasoning consists of constructing mental models to depict the premis
	- Could be a pictoral representation of the relationship between information and the conclusion
	- Effective reasoning occurs when the reasoner checks their conclusion assessed by an attempt to construct alternative models consistent with premises and inconsistent with the hypothesized conclusion.
- **Evidence for both**

## 11a Introduction to Decision Making

## 11b Heuristics in Decision Making

**Availability**

- Thoughts that come easier to mind
- Think that words ending in "ing" occur more than words with n as second letter. "ing" is a subset of the 2nd option

**Representativeness**

- Think things should occur in random order even though they can happen with the same probability, just presented differently
- Thinking that events are dependent on each other while they are independent

**Anchoring**

- First part of the problem acts as an achor, determines to some degree what the answer will be
- Answers for 8! starting from 8 were larger than answers for starting at 1x2x3...
- People tend to make the first few steps and then extrapolate

**Illusory Correlation**

- People expect to see a relationship even though there is none
- Associations that we bring to a situation often colour our judgement

**Confirmation Bias**

- Tendency to search for information to confirm one's ideas

**Overconfidence**

- People's impressions of their own accuracy on a task are typically inflated

## 11c Utility Models of Decision Making

**Expected Utility Theory (Expected Value)**

- Defines ideal performance under ideal circumstances
- Expressed or compared to a gamble
- Calculated as probability multiplied by the outcome and summing the values

**Image Theory**

- People whittle down their choices before they do any active consideration
- Argue that most of the decision making work is done during pre-choice screen of options
-  Pre-screening allows people to make more deliberate and conscious decisions on a small number of alternatives as opposed to weighing all options
- Ask whether a new goal, plan, or alternative is compatible with three images:
	- **Value image:** containing the decision maker's values and principles
	- **Trajectory image:** contains the decision maker's goals and aspirations for the future
	- **Strategic image:** the way the decision maker plans to attain their goals
- Options that are judged incompatible with any three of these images are dropped from further consideration

**Recognition primed decision making**

- When experts are making decision in their domain of expertise, they rely more on intuition, mental simulation or making metaphors or analogies
- With a lot of experience, decision is replaced with an unconscious, more intuitive process.
- As a decision maker takes stock of a new situation, they compare it to other situations they've previously encountered

## 11d Decision Making, Emotions and the Brain

**Sanfey and Collegues: The ultimatum Game:**

- Imagine working with a partner and you're asked to split $10
- You receive 1 offer and you can accept or reject, when you reject you go home with nothing
- Results: Participants reject any offer they don't think is fair even though any dollars is better than none.
- Unfair offers were followed by activations in the insula cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
- The Insula indicated a response to negative emotional states: anger or disgust
- The Insula gets in the way and the emotional response trumps the cognitive response and determines how a decision will be made
- Numerous studies converged on the idea that there is play between emotion and cognition

## 12a Introduction to Individual, Aging and Gender Differences in Cognition

**Roadmap**

- Individual Differences in Cognitive ability
  - Intelligence
  - Role of Expertise and practice
  - Bilingualism
- Difference in Gender, born or socialization
- Difference in Age

## 12b Individual Differences in Cognition

**What is Intelligence**

- Intelligent people are those that carry out a basic cognitive process more efficiently
- **Keating and Bobbitt (1978)**: demonstrated higher-ability children and adults were better able to acquire, store and manipulate basic information than same age peers
- Our ability to do things like retrieve information from memory improves as we age
- **Bell Curve, Hernstein and Murray**: argued that there is a general cognitive ability that is relatively stable over the course of a person's lifetime. Ex: IQ test.
- **Gardner**: View is there is at least 6 difference dimensions of intelligence
  - Linguistic
  - Logical-mathematic
  - Musical
  - Bodily-Kinesthetic
  - Spatial
  - Interpersonal
  - Intrapersonal
- Gardner claims that these differences are real and that we would do well to tailor our career to our Individual strengths
- Still big debate about what intelligence is and if standardized tests tell us anything

**Eyal Reingold: Chess Players**

- showed that expertise in chess is associated with being able to use memory in a way that is very different from non-experts use memory
- In experiments, participants were given very brief views of chess boards, somewhere mid0game. After 5 seconds, they were given a blank board to reconstruct what they saw.
- Experts were able to reconstruct 65% of the board compared to 20% of non-experts
- Experts able to chunk chess pieces into meaning groups and used past experience.
- Experts were no better when there were random assortments of boards
- Later research monitored eye movements of experts and showed that they pay attention to different areas of the board.
- It appears that experts are able to recruit their cognitive processes in order to perform a task that are non-experts

**Bilingualism**

- Considered a large exercise in ignoring unimportant information, that is, a person proficient in multiple languages must always exercise control in responding with the appropriate language
- **Ellen Bialystok**: shown the ability to attend selectively to relevant information and ignore distracting information develops earlier in bilingual than monolingual children.
- Also showed that when appropriate, bilinguals are more successful at seeing multiple possibilities from common stimulus, Ex: shown a "rat-man", they were able to see both rat and man. Bilinguals appear to be more flexible when appropriate
- Being bilingual confers an advantage in terms of attentional control. They are better at directing their behaviour to relevant stimuli from an early age. Advantage continues on until older age.
- Shown that when compared to monolinguals do not do as well at retrieving individual words from memory

## 12c Effects of Aging and Cognition

**Aging's effect on memory**

- Semantic memory generally increases (live longer, experience more things)
- Ability to access memory implicitly remains relatively stable across life
- What changes is the ability to explicitly access a particular episode
- As we build up more memories, it gets holder to remember which experience was associated with what time
- This decline is referred to a decline in episodic memory, which relies heavily on the frontal lobes
- Research shown that later in life we don't encode information or retrieve it as well as we did when we were younger
- Difficulty with source memory: we remember that we heard or saw something but don't remember the source
- Can help reduce and postpone the effects of aging by keeping ourselves physically and mentally healthy

**Why does this occur?**

- Theory 1: We just get slower in terms of the speed of our mind
  - Slower processing can have several implications
  - 1) If we are processing something, other information we might need might decay in the extra time it takes to process the first bit of information
  - 2) Aging is associated in decline in inhibitory process, as we age, it's increasingly difficult to determine what we should pay attention to and what we shouldn't pay attention to
  - Inhibitory processes also associated with decline in availability of attentional resources. Without attentional resources we might have more difficulty blocking out things that don't matter or too little to focus on things we want to process
- **HAROLD**: model that associates changes with aging with changes in the frontal lobe
  - Model says that the types of executive processes that become impaired as we get older are housed in the frontal lobes

**Summary**: Use it or lose it, practice & exercise

## 12d Gender Differences in Cognitive Abilities

- Men typically outperform women on visual-spatial tasks such as mental rotation.
- Women outperform men on visual tasks that require observers to determine when the location of the object has changed
- language skills develop earlier in females and remain  more verbally fluent
- female brains tend to be less lateralized, meaning men's brains are highly specialized at undertaking certain processes in specific areas, this is less the case with woman
- Less lateralization = better recovery following brain injury since the process is more spread out.
- Ex: Often recover better after a stroke

## 12e Summary of Individual, Aging and Gender Differences in Cognition

- Intelligent behaviour involves better recruitment and use of cognitive skills
- Bilinguals show superior abilities at attention control tasks
- The more we collect experiences, the harder it is to retrieve specifics (Episodic memory)
- Aging may slow processing speed and loss of the ability to inhibit irrelevant information with decreased attentional capacity
- Men better at visual-spatial, woman better at verbal tasks
