- Then Second generation of gods. Erebos + Nyx give birth to Ether (air) and Hemera (day). Gaia gives birth to Ouranos (sky) to the Mountains and to the sea (Pontos). With her sun, Ouranos, gives birth to 3 races. The Titans, The cyclopes and the Hundred-Handers. Titans hate their father from the time they are born because he keeps them back in Gaia’s womb and does not let them out.
